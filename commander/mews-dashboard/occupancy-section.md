# Occupancy Section

The Occupancy section features a seven-day outlook on occupancy, arrivals, and departures.

## Occupancy Widget

Below these reports, you'll also see our occupancy widget. This is a graphical representation of the following items:

* **Space types** - Each space type is represented in a bar graph, with color key listed just above the widget for easy identification
  * **Occupancy percentage** - View your daily occupancy percentage by hovering over the bars for each space category
* **Date** - The occupancy widget represents a full week of data, with the first column representing today's data and followed by the next six days
* **Arrivals** - Number of arriving reservations is represented by the blue line, which illustrates the corresponding blue numbers just beneath the widget
* **Departures** - Number of departing reservations is represented by the green line, which illustrates the corresponding green numbers just beneath the widget
* **Stay overs** - Number of customers not arriving nor departing, but staying for at least two nights within selected interval
* **Customers** - Total number of customers at your property is included just under the widget for each respective day
