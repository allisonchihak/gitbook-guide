### Mews Clues

* You cannot delete a space if it has any reservations in the future.
* If a room is within a parent room, you can delete the room from that parent if it does not have future occupancy, i.e. you can delete a bed in a dorm with no future bookings, but you cannot delete the dorm if any bed within it has future bookings.
* Please note that properties are limited to a maximum of 5,000 spaces.
{% endhint %}
