# Vouchers

## About Vouchers

If you contract Companies and Travel Agents with special rates, that you do not want to offer and be available to other parties. So you will have to create a Voucher Rate, which will only be selected once you have selected the contracted Company or TA.

**Public vouchers:** these are rates that require a voucher code \(promotion code\) to be booked, and are not linked to any company

**Company & Travel Agent vouchers:** these are rates that are linked to a specific company, which should be selected in order for the rate to be bookable.

## Create a Voucher 

To create a new voucher, simply click on the + icon at the top of the screen.

* **Name**: the internal name of the voucher
* **Company**: if you would like to link the voucher to a company \(not required\)
* **Travel agency**: if you would like to link the voucher to a travel agency \(not required\)
* **Assigned rates**: this will give a list of all private rates, that can be linked to the voucher. Its possible to select multiple rates that apply to 1 voucher.

## Create a Voucher Code

Once you have created the Voucher, in order to make it bookable via the Mews Distributor with a promotion code, you will need to create a Voucher Code

Simply click on the + button in the settings, and fill in the value \(the promotion code you wish to use\).

**Valid from/to**: this field is important if you would like the voucher code to be useable only in a specific period. The voucher will not work in any date outside of that period.
