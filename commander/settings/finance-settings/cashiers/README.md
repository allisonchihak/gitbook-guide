# Cashiers

## About Cashiers

Cashiers record all cash transactions made in Mews Commander. These include both internal transactions and cash payments on guests' bills. Commander also maintains a full overview of cash income \(money coming in\) and outcome \(money paid out\). Cashiers must be set up in your `Finance Settings` before your property can handle transactions.

At any point, users can view a current shift overview, including the current balance, which should correspond to the actual real-life balance of the cashier.

All cash transactions are recorded in chronological order. Once completed, transactions are organized into shift overviews. Past transactions can be found at any time by searching for the [past shift](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/guide/commander/reports/cashiers#review-past-shifts) during which it was completed. Each transaction is also accompanied by a unique [receipt](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/guide/commander/reports/cashiers#receipts).

To manage cashier shifts and transactions, see [Cashiers](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/guide/commander/reports/cashiers). 

## Create

To create or delete a cashier, navigate to the `Cashier Settings` page using the following path:

* **`Main Menu > Settings > Property > Finance > Cashiers`**

Here you can find a list of all cashiers that have already been set up in your property settings. To create a new cashier, click on the `+` icon at the top of the page and complete the following fields:

* **Name** - Use the location of the cashier or the name of the individual\(s\) that have access as the name of your cashier
* **Ordering** - If you have multiple cashiers, you can set the order cashiers will appear on the main `Cashier` screen \(a value of 0 will place the cashier at the top\)
* **Enabled currencies** - Choose which currencies you would like to accept. This is only applicable is multiple currencies are set up at your property \(to add another currency, see [Exchange Rates](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/guide/commander/settings/finance-settings/exchange-rates#exchange-rates)\)
* **Employees** - A list of employees currently working at your property. Select who should have access to this cashier. Once these users have been selected and saved in the system, they will immediately see a new icon on their screen allowing them to use the cashier. Please see Cashier Responsibility for more information on assigning employees to cashiers. 

When all information has been correctly filled in, select the `Create` button to allow employees to receive payments and complete cash transactions. To open or close a shift, see [Cashiers](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/guide/commander/reports/cashiers).

### Cashier Responsibility

Property admins can choose which employees have access to specific cashiers. An admin may choose to assign a cashier to an individual person, such as a department manager, or to multiple people, such as the employees of one particular department. With regards to employees, properties may choose to set up their cashiers in a couple of different ways:

1. All employees of one department could share one sum of money for a particular shift or work day. Multiple employees could then be assigned to one cashier in the system. For example, assigning all of your reception staff to one "Reception" cashier.
2. Each employee could be responsible for their own sum of money for the duration of their shift. You could then create a single cashier for each individual employee, assigning only that employee to said cashier. In this case, you could name each cashier after the employee that is assigned to it. Under these circumstances, multiple employees could be using the same physical cashier, but they would each be responsible for balancing the sum at the end of their shift.

### Mews Clues

It is very important that every user who accepts money is assigned to at least one cashier. If a user who is not assigned to a cashier accepts money and posts the transaction on a guest bill, the money will not be recognized by the cashier. This will result in the cashier being unbalanced.

## Delete

In the same settings, click on the title of the cashier you'd like to delete. Look for the `Trash can` icon and click on it. When the confirmation dialog appears, choose `Delete`. When you return to the Cashiers screen, this cashier will no longer be listed. Please note that this action cannot be undone.
