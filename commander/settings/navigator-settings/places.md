## About Places

In case you want to add a place to your guides that does not exist \(you were not able to find the required place in the list of places\) you can create it.

Before adding a new place, make sure to double-check whether it was not created already, by searching for it beforehand \(not to create duplicates\). To do so, go to Places in the Settings menu \(youâ€™ll find it under Navigator\) and create your new place.

When creating a new place, all fields are required. Make sure to provide a nice description, price level, tags and a picture.

All places in the system are shared between all of the properties using Mews. Although, the places are visible, guides are not.
