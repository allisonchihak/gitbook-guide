## About Places

If you would like to add a place to your guides that does not exist already, you can create it. Navigate to:

* **`Main menu > Settings > Property > Places`**

When creating a new place, all fields are required. Make sure to provide a nice description, price level, tags, and a picture.

Any place you create will be shared with all other properties using Mews Commander, so make sure that the place does not already exist before you add it. 

You can filter place results by city and state, using the Filter sidebar.
