## About Guides

After you have created places in the city, you can create guides based on these places. To find your guides or create a new one, navigate to:

* **`Main menu > Settings > Property > Guides`**

When guests sign in to your hotel on the Navigator app, they will automatically be presented with your unique guides.

## Create a Guide {#create-a-guide}

To create a new guide, simply click the `+` button, and enter the following information: 

* **Name** - Enter a name for your guide. 
* **Short name** - Enter a shortened version of the name if necessary.
* **Description** - Enter a description of the guide. 
* **Ordering** - Enter a number to determine how the guide is displayed; lower numbers will be displayed first. For example, an ordering value of zero will be displayed above a value of one. In case you need to place a new item at the top of the list, you may use negative values to avoid editing all other guides.

Once you have created the guide, ensure that you upload a nice photo, which you feel represents the guide well. This is important as its the first photo that guests will see on the Navigator Guide section.

After this, you can start to add local places, via the "Linked places" section. Simply search the name of the places you would like to add \(remember to also select the correct city\).
