# Mews Connector

The Mews Connector integration allows our Cloud System to connect with local devices, such as printers, passport scanners, and key cutters. This connection allows commands to be sent directly from Mews to your devices.

Mews Connector should be installed on a computer that never shuts down. For example, many properties choose a back office computer where some of your other software runs. If the computer running Connector is shut down, the connector application will no longer work.
