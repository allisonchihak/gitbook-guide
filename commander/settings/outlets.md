# Outlets

For properties with point of sale \(POS\) outlets, connecting them to Commander can help you track revenue and view outlet performance in the [Accounting Report](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/guide/commander/reports/accounting-report) and [Manager Report](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/guide/commander/reports/manager-report). 

Navigate to the main Outlets page using the following path:

* **`Main menu > Settings > Property > Outlets`**

To add a new outlet, click the `+` button. Enter the name of the outlet, and click `Create`. All outlets created in Commander are listed on the main Outlets page. Select an existing outlet to edit it.
