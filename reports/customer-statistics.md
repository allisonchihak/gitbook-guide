## How to best use the report {#howtobestusethereport}

There are tens of options how to use this report. Every manager may be interested in different data outcomes. Below are couple of ideas which filters you can use:

* **Origin vs Nationality**: If you are seeing a lower number on the Booking Widget for a specific country versus the Channel Manager \(relative\), then maybe consider translating your website in that language.
* **Gender vs Origin**: With this filter you can identify via which channel the values are equal and where it is disproportional. E.g. via your Booking Widget there are the same numbers for men and women whereas Channel Manager brought more men. Maybe it is the description used on the OTA's?
* **Room Types vs Gender**: Is it men or women who is more likely to buy upgraded rooms?
* **Room Types vs Origin**: This chart will give you an idea which origin brings you higher room categories.
* **Address/Nationality vs Average Night Rate**: This will help you understand which countries book the highest rates, and this helps you plan your pay-per-click campaigns to target these high value markets.
