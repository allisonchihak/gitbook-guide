# About Reports

## About Reports

Unlike the more traditional PMS solutions, we built our reports in a flexible way. Each report comes with a set of filters that allow you to manipulate the data and see it in different formats. This flexibility allowed us to work with only a small set of reports that give all insights into the business that an operator needs.

All reports fully export to Excel, and all exports are built in a macro-friendly way, allowing creative hoteliers to build their own reports easily.

Via the Report Scheduler its possible to have reports delivered daily/weekly/monthly and dropped into your mailbox or on an FTP server.

If you run reports with huge amounts of data, we recommend to export the report, rather than running it on screen, as we can run significantly larger reports when they are being exported, and run in a separate queue.

## **Date & Time Selection**

**Almost every report in Mews has a date selection and/or time selection. **

* **Dates only: **when there is a date selection only and you select the end date \(for example 30th April\) this will include the full end date as selected 
* **Dates & Times: **when there is both a date and a time selection on the report, be careful as often users forget to include the last day. For example if you try to run a report for April, you need to select
  * Start date: 01 April at 00:00:00
  * End date: 1 May at 00:00:00 \(not the 30th April 00:00:00 as this will not include the last day\)

## Practical Uses

We have divided the Mews reports into 3 main sections:

* **Reservation-centered: **reports that center around reservations, an displaying reservation data in different mutations to users. This includes reports such as the Reservations Overview, Reservations Report, Room Status, Occupancy Report
* **Customer-centered: **reports that center around customer profiles, and the data mined from those profiles, such as the Customer Profiles Report, Customer Statistics, and Guest In House
* **Finance-centered: **reports that center around accounting and finance, that display data based on the values of bookings and products.
