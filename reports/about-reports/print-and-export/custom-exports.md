# Custom Exports

## Custom Exports

**Unfortunately Mews is not a customised product, and most hotels work with the provided reports to import the data into their accounting report. If your accounting program does not allow our import and you need a custom report, Mews can quote a price for the development of such a custom export \(we do not currently do full 2-way connections for Accounting\). Contact us at support@mewssystems.com if you require this custom export. When you write to us, please provide a full and detailed guide of how the export should work, answering the following questions:**

* **Consumed or Billed**
* **Detailed or Grouped**
* **What does each column mean in the export**
* **What format should the export be**
* **Provide several samples**
* **Note that all materials should be in English in order for us to be able to develop it correctly**
