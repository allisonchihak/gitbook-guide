# Manager Report

The Manager Report is the master summary used by management to analyze the performance of the day before and month-to-date performance of the hotel.

The numbers in this report should always match up to the Accounting Report. If you are unsure about any of the figures that you see here, open the [Accounting Report](accounting-report.md) in detailed mode and find the exact match.

Below, you will find a description of all filters and items that you can find on this report:

### Data Results per Space Type {#resultsperspacetype}

Once you've chosen the desired 'Group by' option, you will see further breakdowns within each of those primary rows, which will include an overview of figures split by each type. Your property may have a variety of Space Types, such as rooms, dorms, bungalows, villas, or beds. For each different type, you will see a group of rows that include the following information:

* **Occupancy** - Percentage of spaces booked
* **Available** - Number of spaces that were available for sale in the specific date selection
* **Occupied** - Number of spaces that were booked in the specific date selection
* **Out of order** - Number of rooms that were placed Out Of Order in the specific date selection \(and were thus removed from the Occupancy and Average Rate calculation, as they were not available for sale\)
* **Night Revenue** - Room Revenue linked to this specific space type \(including any "mother" space type, such as a Dorm to a Bed\)
* **Revenue per available** - Reservation Revenue divided by the amount of available spaces in that space type
* **Average night rate** - Reservation Revenue divided by the amount of sold spaces in that space type
* **Direct night revenue** - Direct Room Revenue \(so in a hostel, the Bed revenue booked only as beds... if there is Dorm revenue, this is not included in this line.\)
* **Customers** - the number of guests on your property during the specified time

Below the group of rows described above, you will also see different types of revenue breakdowns, for each of the primary rows. These results will include:

* **Revenue** - Revenue from that space type's accommodation alone
* **Product Revenue** - Revenue coming from products linked with the accommodation, such as breakfast, city tax, etc. To find a full breakdown of this revenue, use the accounting report, which can break it down into smaller pieces.
* **Additional Revenue** - Revenue linked from cancelled reservations, such as cancellation fees. For a full breakdown, use the Accounting Report.
* **Total Revenue** - Totals of the above three columns, including accommodation, product revenue, and additional revenue

**Revenue** - Lastly, this very bottom column will display the overall totals for every row listed in the report.

### Mews Clues:

* Month-to-date is described as the results for the current month including the current day, so if it is the second of the month, you will see results for those first two day only. Similarly, year-to-date is the same idea with results for the current year up until today.
