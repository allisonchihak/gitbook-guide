* **Cashier** - Name of cashier used for transaction

* **Customer** - Name of customer who made the payment

* **Notes** - This will list the type of payment, including currency and any additionally added notes
* **Value** - Total amount received or paid, including currency symbols

### Mews Clues:

* Mews would recommend that each employee posting payments should print the report at the end of their shift by choosing their name from the **'Employee'** filter. Employees should ensure they have the proper backup, receipts, and bill copies for each single payment taken. These should be double-checked and countersigned by another team member. Once complete, we recommend these be handed over to the accounting department.
* As part of the report, you see a column, which is highlighting the "rebates", which is important to keep record of, since your accounting team may need to approve all refunds given. At the top of the report, you can select to see only refunds using the **'Type'** filter.
