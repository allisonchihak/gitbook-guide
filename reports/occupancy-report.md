## Occupancy Report

The Occupancy report is a schematic overview of all room types, the number of rooms in each category and the business-on-the-books for each room-type per day. The overview offers insights into Occupancy, Availability, Average Daily Rate and Rooms Booked and the sales rates.

The report opens up with net rates \(exclusive of VAT and exclusive of products such as breakfast\). To include the VAT, tick the value filter at the top and run the report again. The report standardly opens a 14 day period starting from today. You can run the report for any length of time. Note that the “Total” column will add up the business for the entire period, not per month.

When you export the report into Excel, it breaks down the results by result group in separate tabs allowing easy manipulation and review of the numbers.

Through the usage of colour, you are quickly able to spot busy dates, which have a darker colour or overbookings, which are highlighted in red.

### Room Type Overbooking

A reservation system should always prevent room type overbookings, as it leaves guests unhappy, and it does not help revenue management efforts. With faster and more modern reservation systems, room type overbookings occur less and less. However due to allotment commitments and other agreements with partners, it will happen at times that you have to accept bookings when you are already fully booked on a room type.

Only staff members with supervisory "Overbook" rights are allowed to make bookings from the reservations screen when a hotel is fully booked.

### Hotel Overbooking {#hoteloverbooking}

Note: even though we have great connections with Channel managers, it might occasionally happen that an overbooking slips through. Unfortunately, as there are a few integrations that are updating themselves, there are always a few minutes time difference between availability openings/closings which might cause that. During a busy booking period two bookings can come in at the same time, while you only have one room available. Unfortunately this is the risk of not managing manually. Notwithstanding that, we see that the Channel manager solutions by far outweigh not having one \(time management, occupancy optimisation\).

### Day use {#dayuse}

Some hotels provide an option of booking a room or an other space type not only for overnight stays, but also for a stay during the day.

When a day use lasts until 6 pm or earlier, the reservation does not take the room from the inventory. The room can still be booked for that day's night stay. However, if the day use booking collides with the 6 pm - 12 am interval, it will be considered a night stay and will take the room away from the inventory. When the room is taken rom the inventory, you will be able to see it in the Occupancy report, otherwise, the Occupancy report is not affected by a day use.

### Sales {#current-article-title}

With the Occupancy Report and Rate Management, we have tried to make the life of a revenue manager as easy as possible, as they have a lot of data to analyse. We combine occupancy, rate, availability and competitor rates in 2 easy reports that allow the management of inventory and rates.

We do not currently offer a pickup report, segment by segment, day by day. However, all our reports can be exported to Excel and can be assigned Macros functionality, that would allow to build custom reports as per your requirements.
