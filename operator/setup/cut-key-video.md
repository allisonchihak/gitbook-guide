# Cut Key Video

## Create

You will need to create an instructional video for Operator, which will play onscreen when it is time for guests to cut their keys

It is highly recommended that you create your own video, as it should display the actual, physical setup of your Operator kiosk and key cutter machine. However, if you are unable to create your own video, you can use one of the following videos created by Mews:

* Video 1
* Video 2
* Video 3 
* Video 4

Below is a list of supported video types, which can be played on any Android 5.0 or later device.

### Format

Operator supports MP4 videos \(.mp4\) using the following video codecs:

* H.263
* H.264 AVC Baseline Profile
* H.264 AVC Main Profile
* H.265 HEVC

It is important that the video file is encoded using the appropriate codec. If there is a problem with playing the video in Operator, please re-encode the file using a different codec. For this, you can use a free, online converter, such as [cloudconvert.com](http://cloudconvert.com/).

## Upload 

The video must be uploaded to the Internet before it can be displayed in Operator. You can host the video file on your property's website, or use a public file-sharing service. To add the file to your [Operator Configurations](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/guide/operator/setup#operator-configuration), you need a complete web address that links directly to the MP4 file. The URL should look like the following example: `https://exampleurl.com/video.mp4`. Video-sharing websites, such as YouTube, are not suitable for this purpose.
