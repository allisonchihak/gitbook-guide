## Using the Mews Translation Tool

The Mews Translation Tool allows users to translate Mews products into their desired language. Below you will find a description of how to use the Translation Tool:

1. To find the Translation tool, visit: [https://develop.mews.li/Commander/translate/Index](https://develop.mews.li/Commander/translate/Index)
2. Locate the `D section` on the page, choose the language you would like to translate to, and`Submit`.
3. Thoroughly read the instructions presented on the next page, and click `I agree, let me translate the file`.
4. At the top of the page, you can choose which product you would like to translate. In this field, all products \(Commander, Distributor, and Navigator\) will be pre-selected. If you would like to translate all products, leave this box as is. To choose a product to translate, simply click on it. To choose more than one product, press the `ctrl` button on your keyboard as you make your selection.
5. To only view items that have not yet been translated within the system, check the box labeled `Untranslated only`. 
6. Below, you will see the following details:
   * **Mews identifier** - Key used in Mews systems as a placeholder for the translated text
   * **Product** - Mews product where the key is located, i.e. Commander, Distributor, or Navigator 
   * **Value in your language** - Translation of English text \(found under the `English meaning` column\) into your own language; these may be empty or pre-filled and should be edited to reflect the translation that you would like to see in the system
   * **English meaning** -  Original English text found in Mews that needs to be translated into your language
7. Below the `Value in your language` column, fill in each box with the translation corresponding to the `English meaning`. If a key does not have a corresponding translation yet, it will be highlighted.
8. When you have finished and all the boxes are completed, click the `Download` button and send the file to [support@mewssystems.com](mailto:support@mewssystems.com).
