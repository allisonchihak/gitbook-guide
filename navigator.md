# Navigator

## About

Mews Navigator is an online web application that allows guests to complete their own personal details for an even faster check-in upon arrival. Each customer can update their own profile to include:

* Name
* Birth date
* Birth place
* Nationality
* Phone number
* Address
* Identity document information

## Customer Data

Guests also have the option to permanently delete their account, which will clear their data from the Navigator app without deleting it from the system.

However, should a guest wish to permanently delete their data from the system, they have the option to do so on the `Shared Data` screen. Here, guests can select a property, and then choose an option to either delete or request their data. Selecting either of these options will automatically generate an e-mail with the guestâ€™s request, which is then sent to your establishment for processing.
