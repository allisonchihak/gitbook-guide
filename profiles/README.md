# Profiles

Mews Commander supports four types of profile:

* Customer
* Company
* Travel Agency Contract
* Employee
* User

## Multi-property Environment

If you have multiple properties that are all using Mews Systems, you and your employees can manage all of them using one set of login information.

When signed in as the Admin, you will need to create at least one employee profile in each hotel. When you've created a user in two or more hotels using the exact same e-mail address, the system will recognize this address and will give you the option to connect all properties under the user's avatar in the top right-hand corner. This will allow the Admin to instantly switch between properties for easier management.

After connecting your properties, you will see that guest profiles, travel agency profiles, and company profiles should all be visible within the multi-property environment.
