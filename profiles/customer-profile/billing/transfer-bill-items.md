To transfer [unpaid items](unpaid-items.md) to the same customer's [open bill](open-bills.md), you can move items individually using the arrow at the beginning of each line, or move all items at once by using the `All â†’` button

* [To companions](transfer-bill-items.md#to-companions)
* [To another customer](transfer-bill-items.md#to-another-customer)
* [To company bills](transfer-bill-items.md#to-company-bills)
* [Track moved items](transfer-bill-items.md#track-moved-items)

## To companions

To move bill items to a companion, you must first move these items from the `Unpaid items` section to the customer's open bill.

In the `Open bills` section, click on the `Move` button, and select the name of the companion from the drop-down list. After selecting the correct companion, items will automatically be transferred to that companion's open bill.

> If you move group reservation items to a customer's bill, those items will disappear from the unsettled group-billing list.

## To another customer

To move the item to another customer that is not linked with that reservation, you must first move these items from the `Unpaid items` section to the customer's open bill.

In the `Open bills` section, click on the `Move` button, and select `Another customer`. Next, you will see a second window where you can [search](../../../mews-dashboard/dashboard-header/search-function.md) for the correct customer profile. Please note that you cannot create new customers from this screen.

After selecting the correct customer, items will automatically be transferred to that person's open bill.

If you are transferring nights to another customer's bill, the name of other customer, where the nights are currently located, will be listed in the `Unpaid items` section, as well as the `Nights` section in the `Items` tab for easy tracking.

## To company bills

You can also assign items to a company bill. For more information, please [`click here`](company-bills.md).

## Track moved items

If you have moved a payment \(that is not part of a closed bill\) to another customer that did not make the payment, you can track that payment from the `Payment screen` of the payer's profile. In the payments section, listed under the bill column, you will see a clickable link to the customer profile where that payment has been moved.

When unassigning bill items from groups, it may be difficult to find items that are accidentally misplaced. If you have misplaced an item, go to the original booking, and review the `items` tab where you can see all items and where they may have been routed.
