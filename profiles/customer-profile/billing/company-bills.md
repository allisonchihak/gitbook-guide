# Company Bills

For customers that are traveling for business, bill items can be moved directly to a company bill, or after closing, you can assign bills to a company. Later, you can view revenue statistics by searching for bills that are assigned to one company.

If the company is already associated with the customer's profile, click on the company's name and that bill will be highlighted, expanding all items within that bill.

## Create

To create a new `Company bill`, navigate to the customer profile billing screen and look for the `Company bills` section just beneath `Open bills`. Look for the `+ Bill` button and click on it.

Use the search function in the next window to find the correct company. If you'd like to create a new company profile, select `Create new company` from the drop-down menu of the search function.

Once created, you can move bill items directly from the `Unpaid items` section to the new company bills. Use the `Allâ†’` buttons to move all unpaid items at one time, or move items individually using the arrow buttons next to each item.

## Transfer

If you have `Unpaid items` in the customer's bill and you'd like to transfer them, look for the `Move` button and click on it. From the drop-down menu, select `Company` and use the search function to find the correct `Company profile`. If you need to create a new company profile, simply select `New Company` from the search function drop-down and complete the details.

When you've selected the correct company, click on the `Move` button and you will see that the items were moved to the `Company bills` section under the name of the selected company.

> ### Mews Clues:
>
> If a bill has already been closed, you can still assign that bill to a company within the editable history window, using the same procedure as described above. After that time, it will not be possible to edit any bill details, as it is considered a legal tax document.
>
> If needed, you can assign bills to a company at the `Review and invoice` or `Review and close` screens
>
> Please note that company bills are still linked to individual customer profiles. If you have two customers who are staying with the same company, bill items of one customer will not be visible from the billing screen of the other, even if they both have an open company bill. Items will only be visible if they are staying as part of the same reservation group.
