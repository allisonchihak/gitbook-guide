# One-Click Payments

One-click payments enable properties to close bills and charge payment simultaneously, all done with one single click. To optimize your checkout process and use this feature, there are two very crucial things needed.

First, one-click payments are powered by the merchant integration, so this feature is not applicable to properties that do not have the merchant integration enabled.

Secondly, to use this feature, properties must collect credit card information from their customers. Card details are taken directly from what is on file in the `Payments` page of that customer's profile. If a customer has multiple cards on file, you can choose which card you'd like to use from a drop-down menu before closing.

## Charge and close

To use one-click payments, first you must navigate to the customer profile `Billing` screen of the guest. When ready to take payment, move all `Unpaid items` to the `Open bill` of the customer, and you will see the `Charge and close` button appear at the bottom of that section.

If the customer has only one card on file, **click the **`Charge and close`** button to complete payment and close bill**. This button will be displayed in the appropriate Mews action color with the card type icon.

If the customer has multiple cards on file, the `Charge and close` button will function as a drop-down menu. Click to see all cards available for that customer, displayed with card type icon and the last 4 digits of the card number. Virtual cards will also be marked as such. Additionally, you will see any current preauthorizations listed in the drop-down menu. Click on the preauthorization to charge it and the balance on this bill will be updated.

In this case, **click on the **`Charge and close`** button, displayed in the appropriate Mews action color, and then select the correct card from the menu to complete payment and close bill.**

After you click `Charge and close`, you will be automatically redirected to the bill preview. Here, you can select final details and check that all information is correct. For more information about the `Review and close` screen, [`click here`](review-and-close.md).

When all information looks correct, click the `Close` button, and you will be automatically redirected to the closed bill. Click on the `Send to customer` button to e-mail the record to customer directly. You can also assign the bill to a company, print or export the document for any necessary record keeping.
