# Open Bills

`Open bills` can be defined as any list of items that has not been balanced to zero by a payment made through the Mews Commander. By default, a customer cannot be checked out until their bill are closed. `Open bills` cannot be closed until the payment for those items has been received in full and balanced to zero.

All unpaid items are first routed to the `Unpaid Items/Deposits` section on the left of the billing screen. Here, you can find all billing items that need to be settled before the customer's bill can be closed.

When a customer is ready to pay, move the items to the `Open bills` section. You can use the `All â†’` button to move all items simultaneously, or use the arrows next to each item to move them individually.

## Split bills

To split items into multiple bills or use multiple payment methods, create a new bill using the `+ Bill` button next to `Open bills` section title. A second bill will appear in the `Open bills` section, labeled with the last name of the customer. Unpaid items can then be separated between the open bills as needed. Use the arrow buttons to move items to the correct respective bills. Expand and collapse bill contents by clicking on the title of the bills.

For each open bill, proceed as normal to take payments, balance and close, issue invoices, or assign to companies as needed.

> * Please note that in order to delete a bill, it must be completely empty, with no remaining unpaid items within. 
> * If it is necessary to check out a customer with an open bill, select the `Checkout with unbalanced bill` option next to checkout. Please note that this does not close or balance the bill, rather the open bill will remain connected to the customer's account to be balanced at another time.
