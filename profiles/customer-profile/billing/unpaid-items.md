# Unpaid Items

All items that are posted on a customer’s bill are automatically routed to the “Unpaid Items” overview on the left-hand side of the payment screen. This is overridable if specific routing instructions are inserted.

## New bill item

To add a new item, click the `+ Bill item` button and select a service category. Once a category is selected, a new window will open where you can select the product, quantity, price, currency, and add any notes that you wish to include. The correct VAT is automatically pre-selected.

Move items individually using the arrow at the beginning of each line

Move all items at once by using the `All →` button

## Stay items

Each stay item will be listed separately with its own one-line summary. Click on each to see an expanded list of all items.

> As long as there are unpaid items on a customer profile, the system does not allow you to complete checkout. If it is necessary to check out a guest with unpaid items, you must select the box labeled `Check out with unbalanced bill`
>
> In your stay settings, under the `Options` section and the `Visit Options` field, you can select `Close balanced bills at checkout` option so that balanced open bills do not need to be manually closed each time

## Companion items

If this guest is part of a group, you will see all other customers in that group listed below with their unpaid items. If you move items to an open bill, those items will no longer appear in the unpaid group billing list.

> Please be careful when unassigning bill items from groups because it may be difficult to find items that are accidentally misplaced. If you have misplaced an item, go to the original booking, and review the `items` tab where you can see all items and where they may have been routed.
