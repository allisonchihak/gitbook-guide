# Closed Bills and Invoices

From the moment that a bill or invoice is closed, it is considered a legal document. Because of legality, none of the items on that bill can be amended. However, within your [`editable history window`](../../../settings/finance-settings/accounting-configuration.md), billing address and notes can still be changed.

For detailed information about how to fully close bills, please see [`Review and Close`](review-and-close.md) or [`Review and Invoice`](review-and-invoice.md).

After closing, you will be automatically directed to the closed bill. In addition to all of the bill details that were just reviewed before closing, this page will contain several pieces of financial information related to legality and revenue reports.

Below, you'll find a complete summary of all items that you can find on closed bills and invoices.
