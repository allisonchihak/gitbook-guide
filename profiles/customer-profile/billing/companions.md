# Companions

When customers are part of a group reservation, all unpaid items associated with that group will be included as part of a complete unpaid group billing-list. On the billing section of one customer, each companion will appear as a separate section, with their unpaid items listed just beneath their names.

All unpaid group reservation items will be visible from each of the companions' billing pages.

The name of each companion is clickable as a direct link to that person's billing page. Items formerly visible under that person's name as a companion will now be visible under the primary `Unpaid items/Deposits` section.

From each companion profile, proceed as normal to take payments, close bills, or issue invoices.

## Group bills

If this guest is part of a group, you will see all other customers in that group listed below with their unpaid items. If you move items to an open bill, those items will no longer appear in the unpaid group billing list.

> Please note that all items seen directly under the `Unpaid items/Deposits` section belong to the customer whose profile is currently on screen. Only items that are beneath the name of a companion do not belong to that current customer.

## Transfer items

To move bill items to a companion, you must first move these items from the `Unpaid items` section to the customer's open bill.

In the `Open bills` section, click on the `Move` button, and select the name of the companion from the drop-down list. After selecting the correct companion, items will automatically be transferred to that companion's open bill.

> Next to each companion name, you will see a button labeled `All â†’`. Use this button to transfer all bill items of that companion to the open bill simultaneously, or use individual arrows to move items independently.
