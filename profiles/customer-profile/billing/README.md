## About

We found that hospitality should be all about the guests, since they are so central to the travel experience. Likewise, in the Mews Commander Platform, guests are central to our Property Management System, and thus all bills are linked to guest profiles.

The Billing Screen on the Customer Profile shows all unpaid items that require settlement. Receptionists can move selected items to that customer's bill, to another customer, or to a company bill, depending on who is responsible for settling the account.

The related articles above include detailed information about all items and features that can be found on this Billing screen.
