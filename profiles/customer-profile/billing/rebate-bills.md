# Rebate Bills

Bill rebates can be complicated in Mews as it has previously not been an automatic process. Now, rather than recreating each bill item, users can recreate an entire bill for rebate in just one click.

To rebate a bill, simply navigate to the bill that needs to be rebated, look for the `Rebate` button, and click on it. After confirming the rebate, each item listed on that bill will automatically be recreated in the equal but opposite value and added to a new open bill in the customer's profile, which can then be amended or closed as necessary. Once a bill has been rebated, the button will disappear from that bill so that it cannot be rebated multiple times.

Please note that the original bill will be unaltered; rather, this feature will create a duplicate of those bill items with a corresponding negative total to balance that original amount.
