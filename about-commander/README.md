# About Commander

Within this guide, you can find general information and some useful resources about how to use Mews Systems Commander application.

Before you start working with Mews Commander, we would highly recommend that you keep your personal profile up to date. If you don't do this before you start, you might find that the language or culture settings could prevent you from optimally using the system.

## Cloud Solution

The Mews Commander is a Cloud-first solution, meaning that all the logic is built in the most optimal way for the Cloud. You can open Mews on any web-browser enabled device. We have hotels operating entirely on mobile devices, giving freedom to employees, who traditionally were dependent on printed reports and traditional reception desks.

One major benefit of the Cloud, is that you can access the solution at any time from any location. This means that employees can access is also when they are not physically at the property, so it is important that hotels have a strict security policy in place ensuring they give employees the correct level of access.

Connection to Mews has multiple parameters aside from speed, which means that there is no minimum requirement for optimal connection speed for our properties. If the property has a stable internet connection, the system should be working as usual. Even if connection is slow, the system will always work, but in the worst case, it will take more time to load. If you're ever in doubt, you can check our [`Status page`](http://status.mews.li/), which we will always update in case of any known connection problems.

## Night Audit

One of the major changes we made is remove the night audit from the system, this has a few implications:

* **Accommodation charges**: these are traditionally posted during the night audit. Mews posts these charges at the time the booking is created/confirmed. So all future revenue is already recorded, but because its in the future, you can still amend it, change rates, cancel items, cancel bookings, etc.
* **No Shows**: you can set up an "editable history window" during which you can cancel or check-in no-shows or walk-ins after midnight. Once the editable history window expires, you will no longer be allowed to make changes to bookings. If you have enabled the "automatic no-show resolver" we will cancel no-shows at 6AM each morning automatically and post cancellation fees linked to those bookings on the guest account.
* **Reports**: traditionally as part of the night audit, the system prints out report after report, wasting huge amounts of paper. Mews however allows reports to be printed at any time, and they have a time filter on the report, so that you could run it between exact time periods. In our philosophy the day changes at midnight, and revenue should fall in the day when its actually consumed, not when the PMS dictates it \(due to night audit processes\)

## Customer-centric

We believe that guests should be at the heart of travel, and we wanted to design a Property Management System \(PMS\) to support this same thinking. For this reason we put the guest at the heart of Mews. All bookings, orders, and bills are directly linked to the guest's profile.

In traditional PMS systems, bills are always linked to the rooms, in which guests are booked. So if you need to open a bill for a guest who is not staying in the hotel, you would have to open a thing called "paymaster" which is a dummy-room to which you can link the charged. Mews however has linked all billing to Guest Profiles.

As long as there is a Guest Profile in the system, you are able to post charges against it, irrespective of whether or not there is a booking attached.Should you post charges to a profile that does not have any booking linked to that profile, the Guest Profile will appear as "to be resolved" in the Guest Ledger, which can help you identify potential problematic accounts.

## Personal Data

Another major benefit of being a Cloud solution is that guests can access their personal data and modify it themselves. This ensures much better profile completion and marketing data for the hotel.

Allowing customers to complete their own profiles generally produces an instant improvement in data, as there are no mistakes made in the input of information. This data is received in real time, and is particularly useful for properties using a channel manager.

With customers as our focus, it allows us to create a number of unique and helpful customer reports, which allow you to analyze customer data in depth and get a better understanding of patterns, which then allows you to set your sales and operations strategy.

We understand that the legal requirements for registration in most countries are getting less and less over time, but we still try to improve the amount of data we collect, as it helps the hotel to improve their reporting. The online check-in is a great tool to collect full and correctly completed guest profiles, and our data indicates that 40% of guests who get invited complete the online check-in.

## GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation \(GDPR\) is coming into operation in 2018, so we have built the perfect platform that allows customers to not only manage their profiles, but also the personal data that hotels receive. Customers may also request for their data to be deleted at any given time.

It is very important that customers feel secure and empowered as they maintain their position as the heart of travel and the heart of Mews. We have designed this PMS to be consistent with these beliefs and we intend to keep our customers central in our system and throughout their stays.

If, at any time, a customer would like to delete their personal data from Mews, employees can navigate to that person's `Customer profile` and select the `Profile` tab. Look for the `Trashcan` icon and click on it. This will delete all of that customer's personal data from our system, excluding `Last name`. The customer profile will still exist in Mews in order to maintain billing and reservation records, but personal data will be completely cleared. Please note that this action cannot be undone.
