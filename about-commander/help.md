We also have a live chat implemented inside the Mews Commander. This allows users to ask questions to our support team directly during working hours.

## Mews Travel Club

The Mews community has been growing fast over the last couple of years and we are now have live properties in over 35 countries across Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America. That means a network of awesome hotels, hostels and apartments full of like-minded employees that love to travel.

The Mews Travel Club was created to allow employees from different Mews properties to book each other's accommodation at a special discounted price.

Click on this link to automatically open the Mews Distributor booking engine, where you can choose a Mews property to travel to with a discounted rate, or simply browse until something catches your imagination.

Any property using our Mews Commander PMS is welcome to join the club, however we can only feature a maximum of six properties per destination. If your property is interested in joining the Mews Travel Club,   you can navigate to [the Mews website](https://www.mewssystems.com/mews-travel-club/) and complete a short questionnaire to begin the process. Please note that the properties willing to offer the best value for money will get preference but we can't wait for you to join!
