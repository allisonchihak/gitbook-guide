We recommend all users store the link to this page as a bookmark on their computer. The link leads to our "Status Page" which we host on another platform, ensuring that if anything happens to Mews, you are always able to keep up to date on the challenges we are facing. When we have any outage, we always firstly update this page, so its truly the most up to date platform for information.

Via the Status Page, you can subscribe to updates, so that we will automatically inform you via e-mail or RSS Feed whether we are experiencing any partial or full outage. We recommend that managers in the hotel subscribe to this feed.

## [Release Notes](http://www.mewssystems.com/release-notes/)

We have minimum 1 release of features each week, in order to keep informed about new feature releases, you can always follow this page, which will give a short rundown of each released feature or bug fix.

When there are new features available, users will receive a notification on their dashboard. Look for a notification and click on it for a direct link to release notes, where you'll find information about the newest changes in Mews.

If you have multiple accounts for multiple properties, please note that you will only receive one notification about newly released features, which will be applicable to all accounts that you may manage.

## Contact Support

If you select to contact support, it will open a contact form, which you can use to submit a question to our live support team. Note that as you type the subject of your question, it will offer several articles from our FAQ library, which sound similar and might be helpful.

If you prefer to e-mail us, you can do this via support@mewssystems.com. Always try to clearly define the subject, describe the question in as much details as possible, and it really helps us if you include an image or gif of the screens you are struggling with, so that we will faster understand your question.

## Chat

We also have a live chat implemented inside the Mews Commander. This allows users to ask questions to our support team directly during working hours.
