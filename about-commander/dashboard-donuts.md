# Dashboard Donuts

The Mews home screen is built as a dashboard that gives instant insight into your property's operations. View information about your front office, housekeeping, orders, tasks, reservations, and more.

At the heart of this you see a number of circles, which we affectionately like to call "Donuts". These donuts include summaries of your day, including items that require action as well as other important data. In this section we will cover each donut and the details that they represent.

Below, you can find a description of the seven donuts visible from the Mews Dashboard. You'll also find a guide to the Mews Action Colors, which are used throughout the system as an indication of necessary action.

* [Action Colors](dashboard-donuts.md#action-colors)
* [Tasks](dashboard-donuts.md#tasks)  
* [Departures](dashboard-donuts.md#departures)
* [Arrivals](dashboard-donuts.md#arrivals)
* [Orders](dashboard-donuts.md#orders)
* [Room Status](dashboard-donuts.md#room-status)
* [Arriving Profiles](dashboard-donuts.md#arriving-profiles)
* [In House Profiles](dashboard-donuts.md#in-house-profiles)

## Action Colors

Throughout Mews we have implemented a small number of colors, and always with the focus of using them to highlight actionable items. We believe that a PMS should not be a circus of colors which distracts the user from their job. All colors used in Mews follow a similar pattern.

* **Orange **- urgent action is required
* **Green **- non-urgent action is required
* **Blue **- action will be required at some point today, but not urgently
* **Black & Grey **- action is completed, no further action needed today
* **Yellow **- long term action required \(ie. room is out of order, requiring significant repairs\)

## Tasks

The tasks donut shows whether there are tasks to be completed today, and whether there are any overdue tasks.

* **Pending Tasks**: highlighted in blue, you will see how many tasks require to get actioned today.
* **Missed Tasks**: highlighted in orange, these are tasks that passed their deadline and the orange color now highlights that the task has become urgent.

Clicking on the donut will take you to the overview of tasks where you can manage and complete tasks.

## Departures

Selecting the "departures donut" will take you into the Checkout report.

What do the different labels on the dashboard represent:

* **Remaining Departures**: in blue you will see how many departures will need to be actioned today.
* **Completed Departures**: once departures have been checked-out, they will appear in black, as they have been actioned
* **Missed Departures**: should reception have forgotten to check-out a customer yesterday or earlier, the reservation will appear as a "missed departure" in orange, this colour generally highlights that urgent action is required.

## Arrivals

Clicking on the Arrivals Donut will take you into the Reservation Overview Report, which gives more details on all the arrivals for that day, and allowing you to take specific actions.

What do the different labels on the dashboard represent:

* **Completed Arrivals**: if arrivals have been checked-in, then they will appear in this donut in black, as there are no further actions required.
* **Online check-in**: if some of your guests checked-in online, they will be highlighted in the green colour, telling you that you can prepare the registration card and charge the customer card, to ensure a speedy arrival.
* **Remaining Arrivals**: any other remaining arrivals will show in blue, highlighting that there will be some action required today, but non-urgent.

## Orders

The orders donut is used to highlight if there are any product orders that need to be processed, or whether any optional reservations have expired and need actioning by the hotel team.

* **Orders to process**: should you receive an order via the Mews Navigator concierge application \(for example a room service order\) it will appear on the dashboard as a blue item, that needs action. 
* **Optional reservations missed**: all optional bookings have a "release date" after which the option expires and its important for the hotel to contact the customer to see if they  would like to confirm or release their option. We will show these expired options in orange, highlighting that urgent follow up is needed. 

## Room Status

Room status is also known as Housekeeping status, which can be described as the current state of any given space that is available for booking at your property. The Room Status donut is the performance snapshot of your housekeeping department, allowing you to instantly see the current number of spaces in each of the following categories.

Click on this donut to be taken directly to our [Room Status Report](../reports/room-status.md), where you can find more detailed information about the status of these spaces. From there, you can assign employees to any room for cleaning, inspection, or maintenance

Below, you will find a detailed description of all the different room statuses that you will find in Mews:

* **Dirty -** `Dirty` rooms are displayed in blue, meaning they will require action at some point during the day, but that action is not critically urgent. This signifies to housekeeping that the room requires cleaning. Please note that a customer cannot be checked into a room marked as `Dirty`.
* **Clean -** `Clean` rooms will be displayed in green, indicating that the room is ready for the next action, but that action is not critically urgent. Once the housekeeper has cleaned the room, they can change the room status to `Clean`, which indicates that the room is ready to be inspected by a supervisor prior to the next guest's arrival. Please note that a customer cannot be checked into a room marked as `Clean`.
* **Inspected -** `Inspected` rooms will appear in black, meaning that no further action is required today. After a supervisor or manager has inspected the room, it is ready for the next guest and they can be checked-in successfully upon their arrival.
* **Out of service \(OOS\)-** `OOS` rooms will be highlighted in orange, showing to the operational team that there is critically urgent action required. Staff may place a room out of service if there is a minor defect in the room that can be fixed before 18:00 on the same day. Please note that an `OOS` room will not be taken out of sales inventory and is still available for booking, therefore it is important that fixes are completed in a timely manner.
* **Out of order \(OOO\)** - `OOO` rooms will be highlighted in yellow. Placing a room `Out of Order` is a serious decision that should only be made by a supervisor. `OOO` rooms do not require action today because they are taken out of the central inventory and cannot be sold for the period of time that you have selected. Staff should always try to prevent using this status unless there is no other option. If you need to place a room `Out of Order` while your property is fully booked, the reservation in that place will be automatically reassigned and, if needed, pushed into an overbooking slot. Please note that if a parent room is placed `OOO`, all child rooms will also be placed `OOO` for the same block of time. 

Please see the [Room Status Report](../reports/room-status.md) for more information about changing room status or placing a room `Out of Order`.

## Arriving Profiles

Collecting customer data is really important, in many countries this data needs to be reported to government bodies such as foreign police or statistical office. For this reason we make it a separate tile on the dashboard to show managers how well the customer profiles of arriving customers have been completed.

* **Arriving customer profiles**: highlighted in black, we show how many customer profiles of arriving bookings have already been fully completed
* **Not completed**: highlighted in blue we show how many profiles still need to be completed today.

## In House Profiles

Collecting customer data is really important, in many countries this data needs to be reported to government bodies such as foreign police or statistical office. For this reason we make it a separate tile on the dashboard to show managers how well the customer profiles of in-house customers have been completed.

* **In house customer profiles**: highlighted in black, we show how many customer profiles of in house bookings have already been fully completed
* **Not completed**: highlighted in blue we show how many profiles still need to be completed today.
