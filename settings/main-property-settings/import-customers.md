# Import Customers

The Reservations Import tool is designed to help you import all your reservations from your previous PMS into Mews, so that the reservations are ready and displayed in your new PMS as of the day you switch to our system.

The Reservations Import tool automatically adds reservations to the system using a template spreadsheet. Notwithstanding the system processing the request automatically, the spreadsheet should be filled very carefully, as mistakes would trigger either imports failure or even push incorrect data to Mews.

* In order to start the process, you first need to download the template file. The import file can be found in the General Settings on the bottom of the page, in the "Import customers" section. Click the “Download empty template” button on the right-hand side to download the template. The template is called "Mews import" and comes in Excel format, so please ensure that you have an application to read and edit .xlsx format files.
* Please note, the pre-filled sections of the file should never be modified: make sure you respect all the headers and the format of this file, as the moment the file is modified, errors will be returned when you try to import your reservations in Mews.

## Customers:

We have added red indicators on the headers with useful information on how to fill in each of these fields. Besides, some headers have been marked with an asterisk, marking mandatory fields. The system would allow to fill only the mandatory fields, however, for better reporting we highly encourage to fill as many fields as applicable.

As reservations in the past, often from other systems, are uploaded into Mews, user profiles are created based on the e-mail addresses and customer details that are provided in the Import file. As these customer profiles are created, users will receive an automatically generated e-mail to inform them that their information was used to create a customer profile that is safely stored in Mews and available in case they would like to request deletion or update any information.

## Companies:

* The “Companies” tab is useful when it comes to loading companies that some of your corporate guests might be booking with. Furthermore, you can assign companies to guests in the “Customers” section, that information will be displayed on the guests' reservations and profiles.
* After you have finished filling in the first batch \(up to 500 reservations max\), save the file, go to the General settings and then scroll down to the "Import customers" section. Upload the file by clicking “Browse”, selecting the file on your computer and pressing the “Import customers” button. At this point the system will start processing the reservation import in the background, something that you will be notified of. If everything goes well and no errors are found, you will receive an email informing you of the successful upload of your bookings into our system.
* If something goes wrong during the import, you will receive a system notification pointing out the errors. Additionally, a full report of errors and their full description will be forwarded to your email address.

Please understand that importing customers is a time-consuming task that you will need to plan with care in advance. Probably several members of your staff will need to get involved, as all the reservations will need to be entered carefully, one by one, into the import file.

Please note that each import file admits a maximum of 500 reservations, if you have more reservations to import, you need to break them down to batches of no more than 500 reservations per file.

The first time you import reservations, focus on a small batch of about 50 reservations. It will help to see if you are doing everything correctly or not. Please make sure you check that everything went fine for your first small batch of reservations before moving onto importing 500-reservation batches. Cancelling wrongly imported reservations manually is an enormously time consuming activity.

> ## Mews Clues
>
> When importing your database from your old PMS, please note that your past guests will receive an e-mail notification regarding the safe storage of their personal information in a new Mews Navigator profile. This is according to the General Data Protection Regulation \(GDPR\) legislation, as we must inform all guests that we have their personal data on file by law. For this reason, Mews would suggest that you avoid importing old and irrelevant data. Import only information relevant to your current and future guests.
>
> Please note that, when entering your data, all dates must be consistently formatted in one of the following ways: `dd/MM/yyyy`, `d/M/yyyy`, `yyyy/MM/dd`. If date formats are not entered in one of these formats, your data will not be accepted by the system and you must correct all formatting before import can be successfully completed.
>
> Please note that if a hostel imports all reservations including the space number, the reservation will not be assigned to that space number that is indicated in the Excel file. Rather, space number would be used only in case the originally booked space type is not specified.
