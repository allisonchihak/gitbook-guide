# Main Property Settings

This page includes all primary settings that apply to the entire property, which is split into three primary sections. From this main settings page, you also have access to an additional `Settings` menu, allowing you to easily navigate to other sub-sections of your Mews configuration.

Navigate to your main property settings using the following path:

* **Main menu &gt; Settings &gt; Property**

Please note that only employees with admin rights have access to this button in their top menu,

Admin rights should be handed out very sparingly, as anyone with access to your property's configuration can change any and all settings, which can then have a major impact on your operation. We generally recommend that admin rights should not be given to more than 2-3 people per property.

Below, you will find information about all items that can be found in your main property settings. Click on the links for further information.

## Logo

Upload a high quality image of your property's logo, which will be displayed on bills, registration cards, your dashboard, and all other guest documents.

This field will accept both `.JPG` and `.PNG` images, however we strongly recommend using a `.PNG` file, as they typically look better online and on printed materials. For best results, the minimum resolution should be `1920 Ã— 1080`.

To upload an image, you must first save it to your computer in a memorable location. Please note that all editing must be done before the image is uploaded, as it is not editable within Mews.

When ready to upload, click the `Choose File` button, and locate your logo image on your computer. Double-click to select and upload the correct image and you will be redirected back to the `Main Property Settings` page. Click `Change` to save the uploaded image and you should immediately see the image appear under the `Logo` section header.

To change your logo image, follow the same steps as described above. Please note that is is not possible to fully delete an uploaded image. If you would not like to display a logo image, you may upload a blank image as a placeholder.

## Sign-in image

Upload an image of your property to use as the background image during the online check-in process in Mews Navigator. Please note that the image must be in landscape format for proper display. Also, please ensure that you own all the rights to the chosen image.
