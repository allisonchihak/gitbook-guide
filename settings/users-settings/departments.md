# Departments

Departments are used to help properties identify groups of individual employees with similar responsibilities, and then distribute tasks and orders from guests to those respective groups accordingly.

Navigate to the `Departments` section using the following path:

* **Main Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Property &gt; Departments**

This page includes a full list of departments in your property. From here, you can create, manage, or delete departments as needed.

## Create

To create a new department, look for the `+` icon and click on it. Enter the name of the new department and click `Create`. Upon clicking `Create`, you will see two additional fields appear:

* **Created \(UTC\)** - Date and time that department was created
* **Updated \(UTC\)** - Date and time that department was most recently updated

Departments differ from property to property, as each one is unique in the way they operate. Some common examples of departments include:

* Housekeeping
* Maintenance
* Reception
* Food & Beverage

## Settings

Below, you can find information regarding all settings that apply directly to `Departments` in Mews:

**Tasks**

* **Department** - Select from a drop-down of departments at your property to indicate who is responsible. In the primary Tasks page, you can also filter by `Department` to check on items that still must be completed.

For all services, both stay and non-stay, you can find the following options in the settings:

* **Options** &gt; **Options**
