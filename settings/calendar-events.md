# Calendar Events

Custom calendar events can be used to mark public holidays, special events, or important observances that are relevant to your property's operations.

Calendar events are visible in the `Timeline`, the `Rate Management screen`, the `Occupancy report`, and the `Availability report`. In each one, you will see a number appear next to each respective date, which corresponds to the number of events that are happening on that day. Hover over the number to see event details, which are listed in chronological order.

## Create

To create a new event, navigate to the main `Calendar Events` page using the following path:

* **Main Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Property &gt; Calendar events**

Look for the `+` button and click on it. You will see the following fields to complete:

* **Name** - Title or short description of the event
* **Start date & time** - Date and time that the event begins
* **End date & time** - Date and time that the event ends

When all information is correctly completed, click the `Create` button and you will be automatically redirected to the main `Calendar Events` page, where you can see a list of all currently saved calendar events for your property.

From here, you can click on the title of events to edit details at any time.

## Delete

To delete a `Calendar Event`, navigate to the main events page using the path described above. Click on the `Name` of the unwanted event, look for the `Trashcan` icon, and click on it. After confirming deletion, you will be redirected to the main `Calendar Events` page, where you can create or edit further events as needed.
