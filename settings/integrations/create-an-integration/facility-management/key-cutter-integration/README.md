# Key Cutter Integration

The `Key Cutter integration` is used to connect Mews Commander with several different door lock solutions. These solutions then allow properties to speed up their check-in process by creating room keys directly from the Mews Commander reservation module.

## Integrations

Mews works with several different door lock integrations, which all slightly differ in their setup process. Please see the following articles for a more detailed description of how to integrate each of our door lock solutions:

* [Onity](onity.md)
* [VisiOnline](visionline.md)
* [Hotek](hotek.md)
* [Salto](salto.md)

If you are interested in using a key cutter solution at your property, or if you experience any trouble, please don't hesitate to contact our Mews integrations team for assistance at `integrations@mewssystems.com`.
