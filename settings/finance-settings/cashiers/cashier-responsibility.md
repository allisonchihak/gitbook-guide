## Cashier Responsibility

One of the most useful cashier features is the ability to assign responsibility, meaning that the admin of your property can choose which employees have access to each cashier.

An admin may choose to assign a cashier to an individual person, such as a department manager, or to multiple people, such as the employees of one particular department.

When a user is given access to a cashier, an icon will appear at the top of their screen for access. Through each accessible [Cashier](./), they will be able to complete cash transactions and take cash payments.

With regards to employees, properties may choose to set up their cashiers in a few different ways.

1. All employees from one department could share one sum of money for a particular shift or workday. You can then assign multiple employees to one cashier in the system. For example, all of your reception staff may be assigned to one 'Reception' cashier.
2. Each employee could be responsible for their own sum of money for the duration of their shift or workday. You can then assign only one employee to their own cashier in the system. In this case, you could create one cashier in the system for each Employee and name it after them. In this scenario, multiple employees could be using the same physical cashier on the property, yet they would be responsible for balancing that same sum of money at the end of their shift.

### Mews Clues:

* It is very important that every user who accepts money is assigned to at least one cashier. If a user who is not assigned to a cashier accepts money, and then posts this on a guest bill, the money will not be recognized by the cashier and it will cause that cashier to be unbalanced.
