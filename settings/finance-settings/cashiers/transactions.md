# Transactions

When you click on the title of a Cashier, you will see a list of transactions just under the current shift overview. This list will include cash payments made by customers and petty cash transactions for internal use \(i.e. flowers for reception\).

There are several pieces of information that can be found in this overview:

* **Number** - Each transaction is automatically assigned a number by the system, which can be used to find them for future reference. You can click on this number to access that particular [transaction receipt]().
* **Customer** - If a customer makes a cash payment, the name of that customer will appear here. If a transaction is for internal use and made by an employee, this column will remain blank
* **Created** - Date and time that transaction was created, plus employee who created the transaction
* **Bill** - If a transaction is associated with a customer's bill, that bill number will appear here. Each bill number is a link to view that bill on which the transaction can be found. Please note that only closed bills will appear in this column, although cash transactions on open bills will still be visible on this screen.
* **Notes** - If the transaction was associated with a customer, this column will state whether the transaction is a payment or refund. Currency is displayed here as well. Additional notes can be manually added by an employee at the time that the transaction is created.
* **Value -**  This is the monetary amount that was given or received, including currency symbols. 

## Received

This is where employees can post small incoming cash payments for internal use.

To enter a new received amount, click on the 'Transaction received' button from the Cashiers page. You will need to complete the following fields:

* **Currency** - Select the correct currency of the cash you're receiving from the drop-down list of your property's enabled currencies.
* **Value received** - This is the monetary value of the transaction that you are receiving. 
* **Notes** - Enter the reason for the transaction \(i.e. flowers for reception\). You could also add any additional comments or information that you'd like to be associated with this transaction. Please note that this is a required field. 

When all information is entered, click the 'Save' button. Once saved, you will see the new transaction in the current list of transactions for that particular cashier.

> ### Mews Clues:
>
> In order for a transaction to be linked to revenue reports, it must be posted as a cash payment on the Billing Screen of the guests' profile. This ensures that the system will recognize the payment as revenue.
>
> Revenue is evident in the system when you can see two corresponding bill items. The first is the total value of goods, often itemized, and the second is a negative value representing what was paid. These two can be found alongside one another on an open bill and the balance of both items adds up to a value of $0 when a bill is ready to be closed.
>
> If cash is posted directly to the cashier as a transaction received, revenue is not automatically posted against it, so it is therefore considered a simple cash exchange, which do not impact accounting reports.
>
> * **Example 1:** If an employee is sent to a shop to buy flowers using money directly from the cashier, it can be entered as a transaction paid and the receipt would be included in the shift overview. In this case only an outgoing payment is posted in the cashier, which will not impact accounting reports.
> * **Example 2:** If a customer pays for a minibar item in cash, you must to go to their Guest Profile, post the minibar item on an open bill, and then post the cash as a payment, which will appear as a separate transaction on the open bill. In this scenario, both revenue and the payment are posted and will be included in accounting reports.

## Paid

This is where employees can post small outgoing cash payments for internal use.

To enter a new paid amount, click on the 'Transaction paid' button from the Cashiers page. You will need to complete the following fields:

* **Currency** - Select the correct currency of the cash you're paying from the drop-down list of your property's enabled currencies.
* **Value paid out** - This is the monetary value of the transaction that you are paying. Please note that it is not necessary to add a minus sign in front of the value. The system will automatically recognize the value as negative.
* **Notes** - Enter the reason for the transaction \(i.e. flowers for reception\). You could also add any additional comments or information that you'd like to be associated with this transaction. Please note that this is a required field. 

When all information is entered, click the 'Save' button. Once saved, you will see the new transaction in the current list of transactions for that particular cashier.

## Receipts

After creating an incoming or outgoing cash transaction, a receipt with all relevant data will become available for each transaction.

Each receipt will include the following information:

* **Number** - An automatically generated number used for identifying transactions
* **Created** - Date and time that transaction was created, plus employee who created the transaction
* **Issuer** - Employee who created the transaction
* **Value** - Monetary value of the transaction
* **Customer** - Name of the customer who paid or received the transaction value. If a transaction is for internal use and made by an employee, this column will remain blank.
* **Notes -** If the transaction was associated with a customer, this column will state whether the transaction is a payment or refund. Currency is displayed here as well. Additional notes can be manually added by an employee at the time that the transaction is created.

If the receipt was made during the current shift, you can access the receipt from the cashier page by clicking on the transaction number. If the receipt is from a past shift, you can search by date, find the correct shift, view the list of transactions from that day, and then click on the transaction number to view the receipt.

Receipts are available to print for the client or for your own administration by clicking on the printer icon.
