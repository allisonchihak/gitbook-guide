# Cashiers

## **Cashiers**

Cashiers record all cash [transactions](manage-a-cashier/transactions/) made in the Mews Commander. These include both internal transactions and cash payments on guests' bills. Commander also maintains a full overview of cash income \(money coming in\) and outcome \(money paid out\).

At any point, users can view a current [shift overview](manage-a-cashier/), including the current balance, which should correspond to the actual real-life balance of the cashier.

All cash transactions are recorded in chronological order. Once completed, transactions are organized into shift overviews. Past transactions can be found at any time by searching for the [past shift](https://github.com/mews-systems/commander-guide/tree/aba4aad5c9d2bc8ec74b2a6c202f25d981c8b45b/settings/finance-settings/cashiers/past-shifts.md) during which it was completed. Each transaction is also accompanied by a unique [receipt](manage-a-cashier/transactions/transaction-receipts.md).

There are two cashier pages within the Mews Commander. You can navigate to either as described below:

1. Main Menu - Settings - Property - Finance - Cashiers

   This cashier page is where you can create or delete cashiers.

2. Main Menu - Finance - Cashier

   This cashier page can be used to [manage existing cashiers](manage-a-cashier/). You can also reach this page directly from the Commander Dashboard, under the Finance section.
