# Cashiers

Cashiers record all cash [transactions](transactions.md) made in the Mews Commander. These include both internal transactions and cash payments on guests' bills. Commander also maintains a full overview of cash income \(money coming in\) and outcome \(money paid out\).

At any point, users can view a current [shift overview](), including the current balance, which should correspond to the actual real-life balance of the cashier.

All cash transactions are recorded in chronological order. Once completed, transactions are organized into shift overviews. Past transactions can be found at any time by searching for the [past shift](https://github.com/mews-systems/commander-guide/tree/aba4aad5c9d2bc8ec74b2a6c202f25d981c8b45b/settings/finance-settings/cashiers/past-shifts.md) during which it was completed. Each transaction is also accompanied by a unique [receipt]().

There are two cashier pages within the Mews Commander. You can navigate to either as described below:

1. Main Menu - Settings - Property - Finance - Cashiers

   This cashier page is where you can create or delete cashiers.

2. Main Menu - Finance - Cashier

   This cashier page can be used to [manage existing cashiers](). You can also reach this page directly from the Commander Dashboard, under the Finance section.

## Create

To create a cashier, navigate to the first cashier page location as described below:

1. Main Menu - Settings - Property - Finance - Cashiers

Here, you can find a list of cashiers that are being used in the system. You can also delete a cashier from this page.

Look for the + icon in the top right corner of your screen and click on it.

You will need to complete the following fields. Required fields are marked with a \*:

* **Name\*** - Use the location of the cashier or the the individual\(s\) that have access as the name of your cashier
* **Ordering** - In case multiple cashiers are created, you can set the order of appearance in the cashier screen.
* **Enabled currencies** - Select which currencies you'd like to accept. This is only applicable if multiple currencies are set up for your property.
  * Add a new exchange rate/currency
* **Employees** - You will see a list of all employees who work at your property. Select [who should have access](cashier-responsibility.md) to this cashier. Once these users are ticked and saved in the system, they will immediately see a new icon on their screen allowing them to use the cashier. Please see [Cashier Responsibility](cashier-responsibility.md) for more information.

Click the Create button and your cashier will be saved in Mews Commander.

## Manage

Navigate to the cashier settings to manage your cashiers using the following path:

* **Main Menu &gt; Finance &gt; Cashier**

This cashier page can be used to manage existing cashiers. You can also reach this page directly from the Commander Dashboard, under the Finance section.

Here, you can find a list of cashiers that are being used in the system. To manage a cashier, click on the title. Within each cashier page, you can take internal cash transactions, manage shifts, or view previously completed transactions.

## Delete

Click on the title of the cashier you'd like to delete. Look for the trash can icon in the top right corner of your screen and click on it. When the confirmation dialog appears, click OK. When you return to the cashiers page, you should no longer see this cashier listed.

Please note that this action cannot be undone.
