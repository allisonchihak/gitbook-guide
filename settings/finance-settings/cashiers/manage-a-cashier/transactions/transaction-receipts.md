# Transaction Receipts

## Transaction Receipts

After creating an incoming or outgoing cash transaction, a receipt with all relevant data will become available for each transaction.

Each receipt will include the following information:

* **Number** - An automatically generated number used for identifying transactions
* **Created** - Date and time that transaction was created, plus employee who created the transaction
* **Issuer** - Employee who created the transaction
* **Value** - Monetary value of the transaction
* **Customer** - Name of the customer who paid or received the transaction value. If a transaction is for internal use and made by an employee, this column will remain blank.
* **Notes -** If the transaction was associated with a customer, this column will state whether the transaction is a payment or refund. Currency is displayed here as well. Additional notes can be manually added by an employee at the time that the transaction is created.

If the receipt was made during the current shift, you can access the receipt from the cashier page by clicking on the transaction number. If the receipt is from a past shift, you can search by date, find the correct shift, view the list of transactions from that day, and then click on the transaction number to view the receipt.

Receipts are available to print for the client or for your own administration by clicking on the printer icon.
