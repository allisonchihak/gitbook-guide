# Transactions Paid

## Transaction Paid

This is where employees can post small outgoing cash payments for internal use.

To enter a new paid amount, click on the 'Transaction paid' button from the Cashiers page. You will need to complete the following fields:

* **Currency** - Select the correct currency of the cash you're paying from the drop-down list of your property's enabled currencies.
* **Value paid out** - This is the monetary value of the transaction that you are paying. Please note that it is not necessary to add** **a minus sign in front of the value. The system will automatically recognize the value as negative.
* **Notes** - Enter the reason for the transaction \(i.e. flowers for reception\). You could also add any additional comments or information that you'd like to be associated with this transaction. Please note that this is a required field. 

When all information is entered, click the 'Save' button. Once saved, you will see the new transaction in the current list of transactions for that particular cashier.
