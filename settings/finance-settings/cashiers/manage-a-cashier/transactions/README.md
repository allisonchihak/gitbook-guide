## Transactions

When you click on the title of a Cashier, you will see a list of transactions just under the current shift overview. This list will include cash payments made by customers and petty cash transactions for internal use \(i.e. flowers for reception\).

There are several pieces of information that can be found in this overview:

* **Number** - Each transaction is automatically assigned a number by the system, which can be used to find them for future reference. You can click on this number to access that particular [transaction receipt](transaction-receipts.md).
* **Customer** - If a customer makes a cash payment, the name of that customer will appear here. If a transaction is for internal use and made by an employee, this column will remain blank
* **Created** - Date and time that transaction was created, plus employee who created the transaction
* **Bill** - If a transaction is associated with a customer's bill, that bill number will appear here. Each bill number is a link to view that bill on which the transaction can be found. Please note that only closed bills will appear in this column, although cash transactions on open bills will still be visible on this screen.
* **Notes** - If the transaction was associated with a customer, this column will state whether the transaction is a payment or refund. Currency is displayed here as well. Additional notes can be manually added by an employee at the time that the transaction is created.
* **Value - ** This is the monetary amount that was given or received, including currency symbols.
