## Open a Shift

Once your cashier is set up, it will open with an opening balance of zero.

Usually you start your shift with a minimum opening balance, so that you have some change in your cash desk to pay back to customers who do not pay their bill with an exact amount. To set the opening balance at the beginning of the system, select "Transaction received" and post the amount of money received in the "Value Received" field with a note, describing this is the initial balance setup. Once you have set up your initial balance correctly, you can start using the cashier, taking in money, paying out, directly from guest bills or in the cashier.

Once you have set up your initial balance correctly, you can start using the cashier, taking in money, paying out, directly from guest bills or in the cashier. In the shift overview you will find 2 button:

1. Transaction Received
2. Transaction Paid

## **Close a Shift**

To close a shift, navigate to the second cashier location. You can arrive here two different ways:

1. Main Menu - Finance - Cashier
2. Mews Commander Dashboard - Finance section - Cashier

Here, you can find a list of cashiers that are being used in the system.

Please note that it is not possible to close shifts in all cashiers simultaneously, so each one must be closed individually.

To close a shift, click on the title of that cashier.

At this time, employees should count the money that is physically present in the cashier. This number should match the balance stated in the shift overview.

If the balances match, look for the 'Close shift' button in the top right and click on it. Here, you can find several pieces of information

* **Base value correction **
  * **Currency** - A list of currencies that this the chosen cashier is able to support
  * **Base value \(Optional\)** - The monetary value that you'd like to leave in the cashier for the beginning of the next shift. You may enter a base value for each currency that your property has chosen to support, however none are required.
* **Shift Overview** - this is the same overview that you used to match cashier balance. 

After starting balances are entered, you will press 'Close shift' again and you will see a second screen with the following information:

* **Start** - Date and time that the shift started
* **Closed** - Date and time that the shift was closed
* **Closer** - Employee that closed the shift
* **Notes** - Any additional notes or information
* **Shift Overview - this overview will include your updated balance**
  * **Currency** - List of each enabled currency for this cashier
  * **Starting balance** - Monetary value that was in the cashier at the time that the shift began
  * **Income** - Monetary value that was received throughout the shift
  * **Outcome** - Starting balance, plus income, minus remaining balance. This is the monetary value that should be taken from the cashier and given to accountants at the end of the shift. 
  * **Balance** - Monetary value that is left in the cashier for the beginning of the next shift
* **Transactions** - A list of each transaction that occurred throughout the shift, including base value corrections \(to balance out to the base value\). For more information, see [transactions](transactions/). 

Look for the printer icon in the top right corner of your screen. You can use that button to print this shift overview and give it to your accountants along with the cash that is not part of your starting balance for the next shift.

Once the shift is closed, the starting balance of the next shift will be the balance listed on the most recent shift overview.

## Review Past Shifts

To review a past shift, navigate to the second cashier location. You can arrive here two different ways:

1. Main Menu - Finance - Cashier
2. Mews Commander Dashboard - Finance section - Cashier

Look for the 'Past shifts' button in the top right corner of your screen and click on it.

Here, you can access overviews of all past shifts. Use the start and end date fields to filter the reports by date and you will see a list of all shifts that occurred between those selected dates when you click on the 'OK' button.

The following information is used to identify each shift:

* **Start** - Date and time that the shift started
* **Closed** - Date and time that the shift was closed
* **Closer** - Employee that closed the shift
* Financial transactions - 
* **Notes** - Any additional notes or information
* **Balance per currency** - This is the starting balance minus remaining balance of that shift for each supported currency
