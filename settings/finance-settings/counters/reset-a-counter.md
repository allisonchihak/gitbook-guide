## Reset a Counter

We strongly recommend against resetting your counters, as it might cause duplication of bill numbers if you forget to change the formatting of the number. However many hotels would like to start their new year with a fresh line of numbering, and for this reason they may choose to use this option.

### Mews Clues:

* Properties could also consider [creating a new counter](create-a-counter.md) to use at the beginning of each year, making it easy to differentiate items and fully preventing the possibility of bill number duplication.
* When you reset a counter, it can only be reset to a value of 1, even if you chose to start the bill numbers at a higher value previously. This is the reason that we'd recommend against resetting counters. If you'd like for a counter to reset at a value other than one, you must create a new counter.
