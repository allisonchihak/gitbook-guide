# Counters

## Counters

Counters are used to assign numbers to bills as they are created and closed. Once created, each bill closed through that counter will follow a line of numbering to prevent duplicate bill numbers.

Properties will usually have one line of numbering, and any bill or invoice closed will follow this line of numbering, starting at 1, 2, 3, etc.

Via the bill counters its possible to set up unique numbers, or create multiple lines of numbering. Each document however can ONLY contain 1 number, once the document is created its locked and not possible to change that bill to another line of numbering, as its become a legal tax document.
