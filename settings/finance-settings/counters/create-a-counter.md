# Create a Counter

## Create a Counter

To create a bill counter, navigate to the counter page location as described below:

* Main Menu - Settings - Property - Finance - Counters

Here, you can find a list of counters that are being used in the system.

You can create two types of Counter in Mews Commander:

* **Bill Counter** - Used for bills and invoices
* **Proforma Counter** - Used to preview bills and invoices. 

To create a new Counter, simply select the '+' button and select which type of counter you'd like to create.

You will need to complete the following fields.

The fields for both types are described just below, however please note that if you creating a Proforma counter, you will not see fields for Bill type code nor Display CID. Required fields are marked with \*

* **Value** - Enter the value from which you would like to start counting
* **Name\* -** what is the name of the bill counter
* **Number format** - should you wish to have your bills/invoices to start with a prefix number, this is the field where you can set this value. Note that Bills & Invoices \(currently\) share the same line of numbering. In order to set up for example a starting number 2015 in front of your bills, you have to follow it by a placeholder, to let the system know how to format it. So it would be 2015{0:0000}
* **Title** - important for accounting exports, to show if the bill has a specific title
* **Bill type code** - important for accounting exports, to show if the bill has a specific accounting code
* **Display CID** - Bills and Invoices will display CID codes. This option is only applicable to properties in Norway.

## Delete a Counter

To delete any bill counter, simply open the counter, and click on the trashcan icon to delete it.
