# Accounting Categories

Accounting categories are used for classification and mapping of your property's product inventory and revenue. These categorizations are then used by the hotel or by the property's accounting team for reporting revenue.

When setting up Accounting categories, Mews would advise that you consult with your accounting team for further guidance, since the configuration would be most important to them and it may not be necessary to complete all available fields.

If your property does not use an accounting system that requires categorization and if you're not using an integration that specifically needs them, it may not be necessary to set up accounting categories.

You can assign accounting categories to the following items:

* Room Categories
* Services
* Service Products
* Stay
* Stay Products
* Cancellation fees
* Deposits
* Payment types
* Rates
* Refunds/rebates

In several of the finance-related Mews reports, you have the option to filter results by accounting categories. In some reports, you can group results based on Service, Accounting category, or Accounting category classification. Reports with this feature include:

* Accounting Ledger - filter by Service or Accounting category only
* Accounting Report
* Manager Report

* **Code** - An internal code that is included as part of the Accounting report export.
* **External code** - Codes used by external accounting software can be entered here so that items are easily recognizable between both programs. This field is specific to Mews' accounting exports. Mews recommends that you consult your accounting team for further guidance regarding the completion of this field.
* **Cost center code** - Used to identify the department to which costs should be allocated. This field is specific to Mews' accounting exports. Mews recommends that you consult your accounting team for further guidance regarding the completion of this field.

## Recommendations

Below, you can find a list of `Accounting Categories` according to the International Financial Reporting Standards \(IFRS\) for Hospitality. Use these as a guide or template as you configure your property's financial settings:

These suggested categories are very flexible, depending on what you'd like to track in your accounting software. Usually all revenue statistics are obtained from your PMS, and accounting data is used only for Profit and Loss \(P&L\) purposes, so there is no requirement to have details on financial statements. These P&L reports are 90% manual and very time consuming to complete, as opposed to reports in Mews, which include less data and is therefore much better for many properties. If all your products are set up properly, it may not be necessary to use accounting categories in Mews. It is most important that your settings correspond to your reporting and accounting needs.

Below, you can find recommended categories according to IFRS hospitality standards for hotel revenue reporting. Complete these settings with the corresponding accounting codes, which depend on country and local accounting standards, and also cost centers, which may depend on company structure.

Please note that the below recommendations are examples and some of the categories may need to be further split due to more tax rates. As always, Mews would highly recommend that you consult with your accounting team as you decide how to configure all financial settings for your property.
