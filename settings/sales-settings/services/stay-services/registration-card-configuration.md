# Registration Card Configuration

Hotels have the possibility to adjust certain aspects of the layout of the registration cards.

In order to have smooth check-ins we aim to display as little fields on registration cards as possible that are necessary for the communication with the guest \(e-mail\) or are required by law \(e.g. surname, date of birth, etc.\). However, some hoteliers require to collect more information about the guests. Therefore, you can customize your registration, including or excluding the details that are important to your property.

Navigate to registration card configuration and you will see the following options:

* **Format**
  * **A4**
  * **A5**
* **Options** - Select all items that you'd like to include on 
  * **Display address**
  * **Display confirmation number**
  * **Display gender**
  * **Display marketing e-mail opt-in**
  * **Display rate**
  * **Display telephone**
  * **Display visit reason**
  * **Print based on person count** - When printing, the number of registration cards will correspond to the number of companions 
* **Text** - Information that you need your guests to see upon signing the registration card \(e.g. fine for smoking disclaimer, etc.\) can be placed into the text field which is HTML formatted. Please don't use this field for extensive T&C -&gt; you can have them on your website or print them on the back side of the registration card. If the text is too long, it will be cut automatically.

> ### Mews Clues
>
> Mews would recommend that properties check the settings on your own printer and test print your registration cards before printing for your guests. Registration cards could be slightly different for each property depending on the chosen printer and the settings of that particular device.
>
> You can set up the text in every language your hotel supports or which language is used by most of your guests. Once the customer selects the language he/she wants to communicate with the hotel, the text \(as well as all the fields\) would be displayed in the guest's language.

## Printing

To print registration cards, there are a few locations from which you can do this, and the result of the printed registration card is somewhat different depending on the location in the System

* **Guest Profile**: if you visit a guest profile \(internals section\) and select to print the registration card, it will only print the personal details on the card. As the profile is not linked to a booking, we do not know which reservation details to print, so we leave this blank.
* **Reservations Overview**: if you click on the print button on an individual booking, it will print the full details on the registration card, as the card is linked to a specific booking
* **Reservations Module**: in the "State" tab of the Reservations Module, you have the option to also print the registration card, it will print the full details on the registration card, as the card is linked to a specific booking
