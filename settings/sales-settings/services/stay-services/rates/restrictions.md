# Restrictions

Rate restrictions are used to limit or specify your property's availability. You can create restrictions to require minimum length of stay, set close out dates, or set a minimum number of days for booking in advance.

Navigate to the main rates page using the following path:

* **Main menu &gt; Settings &gt; Services &gt; Stay &gt; Rates**

This page contains a list of all active rates, organized by their rate groups. Each rate has its own separate page for restrictions.

To navigate to the main restrictions page, click on the name of the rate that you'd like to restrict, look for the tab labeled `Restrictions` and click on it. From here, you can create, manage, or delete restrictions.

This page contains a list of all restrictions for the selected rate. Each one is listed with the following information:

* **Restriction type** - Labeled with `Date`, `Earliness`, or `Length` restriction
* **Only for current rate** - Labeled `Yes` or `No`; this indicates whether the restriction applies to only the current base rate, or also to all it's dependent rates
* **Value** - All selected details of the restriction, including minimum or maximum settings, applied intervals, and selected days

Below, you'll find a detailed description of the three different types of restriction in Mews and how to utilize each one.

* [Date](restrictions.md#date)
* [Earliness](restrictions.md#earliness)
* [Length](restrictions.md#length)
* [Delete](restrictions.md#delete)

## Date

If you would like to create close out dates for a specific rate, you can use a date restriction to specify those terms. For example, you may select dates for a holiday weekend that your property is closed. Please note that date restrictions are used only to prevent bookings in the selected interval.

To create a new date restriction, look for the `+` icon, click on it and select `Date restriction`. You will see the following fields to complete:

* **Start** - Choose a start date for this restriction
* **End** - Choose an end date for this restriction
* **Days** - If applicable, select the days of the week to which this restriction should apply; restriction will be applied if the dates of the reservation is within the start and end dates and if reservation contains any selected days of the week.
* **Only for current rate** - If this is a base rate for any other rates, select this option to apply this restriction only to the mother rate; if you do not select this option, this restriction will apply to all underlying rates

When all information is correctly entered, click the `Create` button and you will be automatically redirected to the main restrictions page.

## Earliness

Create rates that are only available up to a certain number of nights before arrival. For example, you can set a restriction with a minimum advance of 21 days, which means that the rate will only be bookable starting 21 days before the selected date.

* **Start** - Choose a start date for this restriction

* **Minimum advance** - Select a minimum number of days in advance that this rate should be available
* **Maximum advance** - Select a maximum number of days in advance that this rate should be available; use this field for last minute rates

When all information is correctly entered, click the `Create` button and you will be automatically redirected to the main restrictions page.

## Length

Length restrictions allow you to set a minimum or maximum length for bookings. For example, if you set a minimum length of stay as 3 nights, it will only offer this rate to people who select 3 nights or longer.
