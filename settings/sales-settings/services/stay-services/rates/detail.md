# Detail

The detail tab of a rate is where you can find all original settings and options that were present when the rate was created. In addition to all items that were present at the time of creation, you will see two icons at the top of this window.

* **Make default** - Click on the toggle icon to make this rate your default; the `Rate management` button on the Mews Dashboard will lead you directly to the `Pricing` tab of your selected default rate; please note that you may select only one default rate
* **Action log** - This calendar icon will redirect you to the `Action Log`, where you can view info about changes made in the selected interval
* **Trashcan** - Click on this icon to delete a rate; please note that once a rate is deleted, this action cannot be undone
* **Name**: Name this field correctly with its full name, as this is the rate that is visible to the customer directly in the Mews Distributor.
* **Short Name**: Create a short name for all the rates, as this will display better in report columns.
* **Ordering**: This put a numerical order into the list of rates in the earlier "Rates" section.
* **Price**: which is the base from which all other space types float.
* **Currency**: Ensure that you select the correct currency in the base rate, as this will affect the sales currency of the hotel. Once you have set the base rate, it will update all future dates with this rate. The base rate is the sales rate, inclusive of VAT, but exclusive of products \(such as breakfast\).
* **Tax rate**: select the correct tax rate that applies
* **Empty Bed Adjustment**: Rooms are sold inclusive of VAT and are assumed to be for the base number of people the room can accommodate in regular beds \(not taking into account extra beds\). If the hotel differentiates its pricing if you , for example, go from double, to single, you can fill in the value with which the rate should drop. Note that in order to lower the rate you have to fill in a negative value \(for example: -10\)
* **Extra Bed Adjustment**: Same as above. The room is assumed to be sold a full capacity of beds, however if you have the possibility to place 1 or more extra beds, in this field you can put the value with how much you would like to charge an extra bed
