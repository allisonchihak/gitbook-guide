### Manage a Rate:

## Pricing

This is also known as the Rate Management Screen.

As you're navigating through this screen, click on any price to manage settings. When you click to edit, the currently selected rate will be highlighted with a black border and you will see setting options appear in a new window.

**Occupancy**: we display the occupancy in this screen, which helps making pricing decisions. Occupancy is always displayed in blue colored boxes, and the darker the box, the busier it gets on that specific date.

**Competition**: we display a number of preset competitors \(data comes from Booking.com, lowest rate available\)

### Base Price

Default rate is the base number often used to help calculate other dependent rates, which excludes all products or additional fees that you may want to add. To set the pricing, there are a number of options

* **Base Price**: click on the value next to the Base Price, this will allow you to set a base price for all eternity. Its really important that you ALWAYS set up a base price, if you do not set this up, you may forget it, and it might send future years to channel managers and booking engines with a 0â‚¬ rate. 
* **Base adjustments**: next to each room type, you can select the box, which will allow you to set some adjustments based on the base price you set
  * Base adjustment category: would you like to base your pricing on the base price, or maybe another room category? If you make it dependent on another category, then we will hide the rate from the main screen, collapsed into the rate selected.
  * Absolute adjustment: to make a fixed price adjustment from the Base adjustment category
  * Relative adjustment: to make a relative price adjustment from the Base adjustment category
* **Day-by-day pricing**: once you have set the base values, we recommend that you manage your pricing based on the base price, and every time you adjust the base price, all linked room type pricing will follow. However its also possible to manage each room type day-by-day manually by clicking on each individual field and setting the price.
