# Distributor Configurations

The Mews Distributor can be set up and managed directly via the Mews Commander.

Properties can set up multiple configurations for use in different places or to send to different clientele.

## Priority

Distributor configuration settings can be assigned in several different places throughout the system. Therefore, as you choose your property settings, it is important to understand the priority of assignment.

According to Mews, the order of priority is as follows:

1. **Deeplinks or URL** - This can include settings for language, currency, city, space, property, start, end, and vouchers
2. **Distributor configuration** - Found within Mews Commander settings; any fields completed with `Default` will take preference from your website settings, however if any specific values are selected here, those selections will override website settings
3. **Website settings** - In relation to distributor configuration settings, these settings will override distributor configuration settings unless any non-default settings are specified there
