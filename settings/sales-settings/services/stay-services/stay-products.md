# Stay Products

## Stay Products

Stay products are products that are offered to customers during the booking process, which they would like to combine with their booking and pre-order. This could be items such as breakfast, pet charges, city taxes, etc.

To help clarify structure of both stay products and stay product categories, you can now find them displayed together on the same page. With the hierarchical display, products within each category will be visible underneath their respective parent categories. To differentiate between stay products and stay product categories, please note that categories will be displayed with a folder icon.

On the stay products overview screen, you will see each item listed with the following details:

* **Product** - Name of product or product category
* **Accounting category** - Accounting categorization as per your property's settings
* **Price** - Price of item including currency
* **Tax rate** - Selected tax rate
* **Charging** - Method of charging
