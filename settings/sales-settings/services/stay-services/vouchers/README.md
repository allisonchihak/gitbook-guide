# Vouchers

## Vouchers

If you contract Companies and Travel Agents with special rates, that you do not want to offer and be available to other parties. So you will have to create a Voucher Rate, which will only be selected once you have selected the contracted Company or TA.

**Public vouchers:** these are rates that require a voucher code \(promotion code\) to be booked, and are not linked to any company

**Company & Travel Agent vouchers:** these are rates that are linked to a specific company, which should be selected in order for the rate to be bookable.
