# Services

Services are divided in 2 sections:

1. **Stay Services** - Manage accommodation rates, cancellation policies, rate management, and more. You can also set up products that can be packaged with accommodation, such as breakfast, city tax, etc.
2. **Services** - Within Mews, a `Service` is a more general group of items, such as the minibar, taxi service, food & beverage, etc. These can be purchased independently of accommodation and posted manually to the guest's bill.

## Hierarchy

When creating stay services and product services for your property, it is important to remember the categorization system with regards to these items. Services include three layers, which help organize and display items properly in the Mews Navigator. These three layers are as follows:

* `Level 1` - Service Category \(e.g. _Room Service_\)
* `Level 2` - Product Category \(e.g. _Main Courses_\)
* `Level 3` - Products \(e.g. _Spaghetti and Meatballs_\)

To help clarify structure of both products and product categories, you can now find them displayed together on the same page. With the hierarchical display, products within each category will be visible underneath their respective parent categories.

Following this logic, your property's services will be built according to the structure of the system and will then display beautifully in the Mews Navigator and also on the customer's billing screen in the Mews Commander.

### Order E-mail

If you would like to send your customer an e-mail at the time of the order of the Service, you can type the e-mail in HTML in this field. Once the product is ordered by the customer \(via Navigator or directly in the Commander\), the system will trigger to send an e-mail to the guest. Of course we can only send confirmation e-mail to guests who have a valid e-mail address in their Guest Profile.

### End E-mail {#endemail}

For some services, such as Accommodation, you may want to send an e-mail as a follow up once the service ends, to ask them how the service was enjoyed, or ask for feedback. Note that we can only send an end-email for services that have an end-date. At this moment, we only recommend setting this for Accommodation Services.
