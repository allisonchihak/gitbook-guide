# Custom Links

## Custom Links

In Mews, it is possible to create shortcuts for pages that you regularly need to use. To create a new custom link, you must first navigate to your main property settings using the following path:

* **Main Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Property**

On this page, you will see a list of settings. Look for the `Custom links` button and click on it to be redirected to a new page. Once there, find the `+` icon, click on it, and fill in the following details:

* **Name** - Create a short title for the bookmark 
* **URL** - Add the web address for the page that your want the custom link to redirect to; please note that this URL can be for an external web page or one within Mews Commander 

When both fields have been completed, click `Create`. The bookmarked page will appear in the main menu under the `Custom links` tab, allowing you to quickly navigate to pages that you need to use on a regular basis.
