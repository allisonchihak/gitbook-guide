Once you have created the guide, ensure that you upload a good photo, that you feel represents the guide well. This is important as its the first photo that guests will see on the Navigator Guide section to entice them to browse the guide.

After this, you can start to add local places, via the "Linked places" section. Simply search the name of the places you would like to add \(remember to also select the correct city\).
