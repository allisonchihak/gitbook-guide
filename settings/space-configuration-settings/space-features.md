# Space Features

## Space Features

Its possible to set up Space Features, which \(as the name states\) are the different features of the space. For example if a room is close to an elevator, high floor with a small bathroom, it might be good to set up these space features and link them to that room. This way any reception agent making room assignments, will be aware of these particular room features.
