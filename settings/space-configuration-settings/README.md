# Space Configuration Settings

## Space Configuration Settings

Mews is one of the more flexible solutions in terms of room/bed configurations. So rather than calling everything "Rooms" we have gone beyond this, and can now name a number of different types of spaces \(Beds, Dorms, Rooms, Villas, etc\), giving hoteliers much more flexibility.

Based on this we generally refer to this as "Spaces"

We can calculate Occupancy and Average Rates based on specific Space Types. We are also able to link spaces to each other through dependencies. For example if you are a hostel, its possible to create a Dorm for 4 people, and as part of that dorm you can build 4 Beds. So you can either sell the beds individually, or you can book the entire dorm in 1 go. The spaces are interdependent, so if you book a sub-space, it instantly also takes this into account for the availability of the mother/child spaces.
