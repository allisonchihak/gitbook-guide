# Optional Reservations Missed

When you create an Optional Booking, you are always asked at which date you would like that option to expire. Once the option passes its expiry date, it will appear in the dashboard under the optional reservations in orange, signalling that urgent action is required.

Opening this report will take you to a list of all the optional bookings that have expired with some basic details of the bookings. Selecting any booking will open the reservation module in the "state" tab, where you can either confirm or release the booking.

Once the booking is released we will communicate this newly opened availability to the booking engine and channel managers to try to help to reseller this unsold room.
