## Reservation Overview

The Reservation Overview Report is a quick snapshot of all bookings on Arrival, Departure, In House and Statistics. It always shows the most up-to-date status of the remaining arrivals and departures to ensure that the front office at any time is able to check which guests are still requiring action.

We split the reservations, and will always show the reservation cards of those bookings that still require action today, at the top of the screen. Once a reservation is checked-in or out, it will move to the bottom of the screen, allowing the user to focus on those customers who are still to be "actioned"

Each reservation has a card, which gives a quick snapshot of information and some action buttons:

* Customer Name
* Assigned Room Number
* Arrival and departure date of the reservation
* Guest names of other guests in the room
* Reservation Notes
* Icons depicting whether the customer has any customer classification set
* Confirmation numbers
* Number of persons on the booking
* Room State
* Reservation State
* Quicklinks to the booking on the timeline, customer bill and to print the registration card
* Button links to details of the booking, or to start the check-in/out process
