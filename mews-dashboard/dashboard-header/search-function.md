# Search Function

At the top of the screen you will find the search box. Use this field to search for bookings or profiles using any of the following criteria. Searches will begin as soon as you start typing, and results will appear in a drop-down list. Select any item to open further details or continue typing to find more specific results.

## Customer name

Search by first or last name, but please be sure that the name is complete. For example, 'John' and 'Doe' will both produce results, but 'John D' will not.

Please note that commas will not produce correct results, so we would recommend not using them in your search.

## E-mail address

You can search for the e-mail address of the reservation holder or any registered companion to find a booking

Please note that bookings should never be registered under the e-mail address of another person \(for example, a travel agency or secretary\), but rather they should always be the e-mail address of the person who is staying at the property.

## Confirmation Numbers

There are three different types of confirmation numbers. You can use any of these to find bookings through the search box.

1. **Mews** - Mew will automatically allocate a unique confirmation number for each booking, which you can use to search.
2. **Online Travel Agency** - If your hotel is connected through an Online Travel Agency, Mews System will records OTA confirmation numbers, which you can use to search for bookings.
3. **Channel Manager** - If your hotel is connected through a Channel Manager, Mews System also records the Channel Manager confirmation numbers, which you can use these to identify bookings.

## Room Number

Searching by room number will produce results for all items associated with that space. The drop-down results will include bookings that were assigned to that space \(regardless of state\), space blocks, or you can also click on the room number to see that room's properties.

## Group Name

Each booking is assigned a unique group name, which you can use as a search tool. Please note that group names cannot contain any spaces.

## Company

If the reservation is associated with a company profile, you can use that company's details as a search tool. Use any of the following details to find the correct profile:

* **Name** - If you have multiple companies with the same name, you will also see them displayed with the full address details to clarify
* **Address** - Search by street name or city to produce results, although full address is not necessary

Please note that you can only search for companies that are active. If you have deleted a company from the system, it will not be displayed in the search results.

## Travel Agency

Search for any active travel agency contracts by name. If you have deleted a contract, it will not appear in the search results.

## Bills and Invoices

Each bill and invoice is assigned a number. You can use these numbers to search for a specific bill. Please note that only closed bills and invoices will have an assigned number that is searchable. If you are looking for an open bill, you must search by customer or using one of the other criteria listed above.

If the bill or invoice has a word in front of the number \(i.e. 'Bill 12'\), you can only use the number to search. You could find that bill searching for '12', but 'Bill 12' will not produce any results. If the bill consists of multiple consecutive numbers, please be sure to search for the full bill number to produce the correct results.
