# Messages

The messaging feature can be used both internally for messages between your staff, and also externally, if your guests would like to send a message to your employees via the Navigator Application.

Messages are always accessible from the header of the Mews dashboard using the `Envelope` icon. Below, you will find a detailed description about how to use messages in Mews.

## Previews

Your new and most recent messages are visible as previews in the `Envelope` icon drop-down. Each preview contains the following pieces of information:

* **Sender** - First and last name of sender, displayed with their profile image
* **Message preview** - Contents of the message, displayed in `"quotations"`; for longer messages, preview will contain the first several lines
* **Sent time** - Date and time that message was sent

## New

When you receive a new message, the system will produce a bell sound and you will see a number in orange over the `Envelope` icon, which corresponds to the number of new messages. Click on the icon to open and view your message previews.

When you click on the `Envelope` icon, you will see message previews as described above, all marked with an orange state badge labeled `New`. Click directly on each new message to open that thread and respond to your guest or colleague.

When you open all messages, you will see the message thread containing that new message highlighted in blue, indicating that action is required. When you click on the message thread, the blue highlight will disappear.

In the messages drop-down menu, you can click the `Mark all as read` button to simultaneously change the status of all messages to `Read`. Mews would recommend against using this feature, as it is important to read all messages received by customers and colleagues.

## Ellipses

Within the messages drop-down menu, next to each message preview, you will see an `ellipses` icon. If the message is new, you will see an option labeled `Mark as seen`. Click on this option to remove the `New` badge and also to remove the notification from the `Envelope` icon in your Dashboard header. Please note that selecting `Mark as seen` will not open the message thread for viewing.

If a message is not new, you will see an option called `Mark as pending` when you click on the `ellipses` icon. This will re-add the `New` badge to the message preview and add a notification back to the `Envelope` icon on your Dashboard header.

## All Messages

To see all messages, click on the `Envelope` icon and select `Messages`. You can also access this main messaging page by opening the main menu and selecting 'Messages'. Furthermore, when you click on a message preview to open a thread, you will automatically be redirected to the main messages page.

## Threads

To create a new thread, open the main messages page by clicking on the `Envelope` icon and then selecting `Messages`. Look for the `+` button next to `Threads` and click on it.

Next, you will see the center panel labeled with `New thread`. Look for the `Edit` icon and click on it to change the name of your thread. If you do not change it, the thread will retain the title `New thread`.

Message thread titles are editable at any time, and can be changed by any member of the thread.

One message thread will be open at all times, however you can easily switch to a different one by clicking on its title.

## Members

To add a member to a thread, look for the `Members` section, and in the field labeled `Add members`, you can search by first name, last name, or e-mail address. All members who match that search criteria will appear in a drop-down list. Select a member from the drop-down and they will automatically be added to the current thread. You will see a full list of members in the highlighted thread listed under the `Members` section with the following details:

* **Name** - Employee name and profile image
* **E-mail** - E-mail address associated with that person's account 

Please note that you can only add other employees to new threads and also existing ones.

Please note that if you are adding a member to an already existing thread, that new member will be able to see all messages in the thread that were sent before they were added.

Please also note that once a member is added, that user cannot be removed from the thread. Rather, you must create an entirely new thread with only the desired members.

## Privilege

When setting up your employee profiles, you will see an item labeled `Receive customer messages`.

Select this option to allow specific employees to receive messages from customers via Mews Navigator. This option is still editable after employee profiles are created, so you can select and deselect this item as needed. Please see our article on [`Employee Profiles`](../../profiles/employee-profile.md) for more information.

Please note that if this option is not selected, employees can only receive internal messages from other employees.
