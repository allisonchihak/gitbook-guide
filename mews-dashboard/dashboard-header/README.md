# Dashboard Header

## Dashboard Header

The Dashboard header is the bar that runs across the top of your screen. This bar will be present throughout the whole commander, regardless of what part you're visiting. There are several resources we've made easily accessible by keeping them here.

You can find:

* Main Menu
* Mews Button
* Search Function
* Timeline
* New Reservation
* Reservation Overview Report
* Notifications
* Messages
* User Profiles
