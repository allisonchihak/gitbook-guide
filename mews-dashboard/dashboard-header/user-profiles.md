# User Profiles

Users can find their profile data in the top right-hand corner of the Mews Dashboard Header. Here, you can find a circular icon stating the first letter of your last name, or if you have uploaded a profile image, you will see that image here instead. Overlapping your profile image, you will see a smaller icon representing the current property that you are logged into.

When you click on this icon, the following options will appear in the drop-down menu:

* **Profile** - Click to open your profile data, settings, and security preferences
* **Sign out** - Click here to sign out of your profile and you will be automatically be redirected to the Mews login page

Additionally, if you have access to multiple properties, you will see a `Search` feature to quickly find any specific property within your chain. Each accessible property will appear in the drop-down menu as an individual item. Click on the name of a property to switch between them. As you switch properties, you will see the smaller overlapping icon change accordingly, based on the property that you are currently viewing.

Please note that each user will have only one user profile, even if they are given access to multiple properties. For more information about chain access, please see our [`Employee Profile`](../../profiles/employee-profile.md) article.

Click on `Profile` to open and make changes to your user profile. The user profile is divided into four primary sections, which are described in detail below:

## Personal Information

* **E-mail** - Often your work e-mail address, this is used for the initial setup of your account; you can also use this e-mail address to log in to your account
* **Title** - Choose the title that is most applicable; gender data is taken from this selection
* **First name** - Your first given name
* **Last name** - Your surname
* **Username** - Create a unique username; you can use this or your e-mail address to log in
* **Nationality** - Select your nationality from the drop-down menu of countries
* **Birth date** - Your date of birth
* **Birth place** - Place of birth
* **Telephone** - Your current phone number
* **Language** - Select the language in which you would like the system to be displayed. Please note that English is the default language, so English will appear in all places where translations are missing for the selected language
* **Culture \(Formatting\)** - Selected culture will determine the formatting of all dates and numbers displayed in the system. For example, if you select `Czech`, days of the week will all be displayed in the Czech language, dates will appear in `DD.MM.` format, and decimals, such as 6.5 \(six and a half\), will be written as `6,5`, using a comma instead of the decimal point.
* **Default account** - If you have access to multiple properties, you will see all these properties listed in the drop-down menu. Select which property you would like to set as your default, so that when you next log in to the system, this property will always be selected.

## Change Profile Image

Your profile image will be associated with your user profile and visible to all other users as an identifier. In addition to your own image, user profile images are displayed in `Action logs` as well as all `Employee hierarchy` tables. For this reason, Mews would recommend that each user chooses a different and appropriate profile image for easy identification.

Users may change their own profile image at any time. To upload a photo or change your current photo, you must first download and save the image to your computer. Mews supports images in `.png` or `.jpg` format only.

When your image is ready to upload, click the `Choose File` button and select the correct file from your computer. After selecting, you will see the selected file name appear next to the `Choose File` button along with a preview of that image.

If you are satisfied with the preview, click `Change` to save the profile image. If you are not satisfied, you may continue editing your image and select `Choose file` whenever you are ready to upload.

> Please note that images should be edited before upload, using your image editing software of your choice. For the best results, since images are uploaded to a circular template, we would recommend that you crop your image into a square before uploading.

## Change Password

If needed, you can change your account password from this page.

To reset your password, enter your current password in the field labeled `Old password`. Next, enter your new password twice in the fields labeled `New password` and `New password again`.

When all fields are correctly completed, click `Change` to save your new password and look for a green success message.

## Security

`Two-factor authentication (2FA)` is used to secure your account by requiring verification from two different devices before you can successfully log in. You can enable `Two-factor authentication` to add an extra layer of security for data protection. After enabling, you must confirm your identity each time before anyone can gain access using your login details.

First, you must download an authenticator application to your mobile device. You can find a button labeled `Download Authenticator` , which will automatically redirect you to download the LastPass authenticator. Mews also supports Google authenticator if preferred. 

Next, to enable `2FA`, navigate to the `Security` tab of your user profile and click the `Edit` button and you will see a unique QR code appear on the screen.

Next, open your authenticator application of choice, scan the QR code displayed on the screen. You will see the following two fields to complete:

* **PIN code** - Security PIN provided by your authenticator application; this code will be continually changing
* **Password** - Your current account password

When all information is correctly entered, click `Authenticate` to complete your `2FA` setup. Upon successful enabling, you will receive a list of ten `One time recovery codes`. These codes can be used only one time each to recover your account in case you have lost a device or cannot authenticate your login for any other reason.

Please note that these recovery codes will only be displayed once. Mews would recommend that you store these codes in a secure place, as they can be used to gain immediate access to your account and personal data.

To disable `two-factor authentication` on your account, navigate to the security tab, click `Edit` and you will be asked to enter your pin code and password. After clicking `Authenticate`, `2FA` should be successfully disabled.
