# Simple Detail

Once you select a booking on the timeline, a small window will appear on the right hand side of the screen, which we call the "Simple Detail" as its a simple overview of some details of the booking. The screen contains all important reservation fields which give all details on the booking, source, origin, notes, etc.

## Header

* Customer profile icon: next to the guest name there is an icon of a puppet, if you click the icon, it will take you into the guest profile.
* Lock & unlock reservation: next to the guest name you will also find the lock-icon. Locking a reservation means that no-one will be able to manually or automatically move this booking to another space without first unlocking the reservation. This feature helps prevent potential customer complaints, when the guest has requested a specific room number. If a room is locked, the toggle button will be highlighted in blue and you will see a `Lock` icon on the corresponding reservation block.

## Key Action Buttons

* Manage: this button will take you into the "properties" tab of the booking
* Group: this button will take you to the "group" tab of the booking
* Check-in or Checkout: this dynamic button will signify that a booking is either on arrival or departure, and will take you straight into the "state" tab of the booking to complete the check-in/out
