# Reservations

## Reservations

Key to a PMS is the possibility to make and maintain reservations. So also Mews support the creation and modifications of both individual and multiple bookings.

What at the core in Mews is different from traditional PMS solutions is that we would not like to complicate the booking process by having a separate "individual booking" and "group booking" module. Instead we focus on making the user interface flexible and friendly enough to allow for making single and multiple bookings from the same screen, without overcomplicating the process.

The lack of a separate groups-module usually causes some initial confusion to seasoned hoteliers, as they have always had this with older solutions. However once they get used to it, most will agree that less modules, lead to less confusion with the team and improved system usage.

### Find a Reservation

In order to manage an existing reservation, you need to find the booking first. There are a few methods to quickly find a booking:

* The quickest way is to type the guest name/e-mail/confirmation number/room number in the search box at the top menu. Once you select the customer, you will be redirected to the Customer Dashboard where you have an overview of all future bookings of this client. Please select “Manage Booking.”
* You can select a booking directly on the timeline. The booking details will appear from the right. Please select “Manage” to open the “Manage Booking” screen.
* From the reservation overview or reservation report, you can find a booking based on different filters. The bookings are selectable and once you open the booking, press “Manage.”
