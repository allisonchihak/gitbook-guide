# Create a Reservation - NNRS

In Mews Commander, new reservations can be created at any time from any screen within the system. Using the `+` button in the primary header, you can immediately open the `New reservation screen`, where you will complete the booking details and finalize the reservation in three steps.

Below, you can find a detailed description of the complete reservation-making process, which is divided into the three respective steps.

**To create a reservation, look for the **`+`** button in the Mews header and click on it.**

* [1 - Availability](create-a-reservation-nnrs.md#1---availability)
* [2 - Rates](create-a-reservation-nnrs.md#2---rates)
* [3 - Summary](create-a-reservation-nnrs.md#3---summary)
* [Group Bookings](create-a-reservation-nnrs.md#group-bookings)

## 1 - Availability

Upon clicking on the `+` button, you will automatically be redirected to a new window, which we fondly refer to as the `New reservation screen`.

The first step is divided into two sub-parts.

First, you will see a three-month calendar including the current month and the following two months, with today's date highlighted for reference.

Click to select the arrival and departure dates for this booking in either order, which will highlight in blue after selection. The moment that you select the second date, the window containing the calendars will automatically collapse.

If you are working with a multi-property chain, you will see an additional field for `City` appear when you select the second date. This `City` field contains a drop-down menu of all the cities where your chain properties are located. Select the city where this booking should be made and availability will load in the next step based on your selection.

> Please note that the dates selected in the first step will be visible while completing the second part of the first step. If you need to change arrival or departure before finalizing, click on the dates to reopen the calendar and make the correct selections.

Next, you will see your property's availability load below automatically, based on your date and city selection. You will see tabs above for each space category, which you can switch between to display all subsequent space types within each category. `Availability` is displayed next to each one, indicating the number of spaces that are available for booking, along with the `Default price` for each one. When you're ready to choose, click on the `Select` button next to the correct space type.

> Please note that if there is no remaining availability in any particular space type, the `Select` button will automatically change to say `Overbook`, meaning that employees can book more people in a room than what they system has listed as the maximum occupancy. Please note that employees must be given the specific privilege to overbook.
>
> If you choose to overbook a space type, reservation will appear in an overbooking slot which is visible from the timeline. Users will be presented with a confirmation before the overbooking is accepted, but please note that this is up to the property's discretion regarding whether they are willing and able to accommodate more guests in any one space.

In the moment that you click `Select`, you will be redirected to the next step in the booking process.

## 2 - Rates

In the next screen, you will see the three following sub-sections. Please note that all required fields are marked with `*`. The first subsection includes the following fields to complete:

* **Customer\* ** - Search for the correct customer using first name, last name, or e-mail address; select `New customer` from the search field drop-down if you cannot find an existing customer profile
* **Company** - If this is a business reservation, search for the company profile; select `New company` from the search field drop-down if you cannot find an the correct company; if you select a company, the system will automatically search through private rates that may be applicable

The next few fields are dependent on your selections in the previous step and will be displayed :

* **Person count per space** - For each chosen number of spaces, select the number of adults and children that will be staying in each; please note that this field will be pre-filled with the maximum number of individuals allowed per the selected space type

Next, you will see all available rates for the chosen space type, listed with their price `per night` and also the `total amount` for stay.

Rates are displayed according to their rate group, which is the group of rates that have the same cancellation policy. The second step will automatically display the lowest available rates, which ensures that the customer is offered the lowest available price at the time of booking.
