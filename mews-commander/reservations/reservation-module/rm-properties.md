## Arrival & Departure

Before you start editing booking details, please be sure to select only the reservations you wish to amend. Note that if you select multiple bookings with the same arrival and departure dates, the system will pre-fill the date fields with the correct dates. If you select bookings with different dates, it will not be able to pre-fill these fields.

If you are extending a booking with additional nights, there is no need to tick the box "Cancel without Fee" as this button is not applicable for extensions.

This section contains the following items:

* **Arrival** - Date and time selection for time of arrival
* **Departure** - Date and time selection for time of departure

To change either of these details, navigate to this `Properties` tab of the Reservation module and select the correct date or time from these date and timepicker fields. When you have correctly selected the amended date or time, click `OK` and you should see a green success message that the interval of the booking was successfully changed.

If you do change any reservation details, you may want to re-send a confirmation e-mail to the customer to be sure that everyone is properly informed of the booking change.

## Room Category

If you would like to change the booked room category to a higher or lower category in the system, you can select the new room category here. When you make this change, you need to decide whether you would like to keep the old price or whether you would like the system to re-price it against the pricing set in the system \(for those specific dates and the new room type\).

## Adults & Children

If the occupancy of the room has changed, you can select here the new number of people occupying the room. If you tick the box "Keep Old Price," it will keep the base price the same. Please note that the only thing the system will add or subtract is the cost of the per-person-per-night items within the booking \(such as breakfast cost\).
