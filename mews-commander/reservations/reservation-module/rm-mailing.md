# RM: Mailing

You can access the reservation module by clicking `Manage` button within the `Simple detail` for any reservation.

From the `Mailing` tab of the reservation module, you are able to manually re-send e-mails to your customers. All e-mails will be sent to the customer's registered e-mail address by default, or you can choose to send them to a custom e-mail address instead.

## Resend e-mail

Depending on the current state of the reservation, you can resend the following types of e-mail:

* **Cancellation** - If the booking is cancelled, you can send the customer a confirmation of his/her cancellation
* **Confirmation** - Resend a confirmation e-mail including all booking details
* **Quotation** - Available only for optional bookings, this e-mail includes a price quotation, booking details, and release date.
* **Invitation to online check-in** - If you would like the customer to fill in their credit card details, this e-mail will confirm booking details and will include a link where they can check in online.
* **Release date reminder** - If an optional booking is close to its release date, you can manually trigger an e-mail that will prompt them to confirm their booking before that date. 
* **After start e-mail** - Resend a welcome message to your guests after they have arrived and completed check-in

Below, you will see two additional fields that are optional to complete:

* **Language** - It is possible to send an e-mail in multiple languages, but it's important that you have created templates for each language that you would like to have available. If this field is not specified, the system will send the e-mail in the Default property language. If your default property language is not determined and there are no e-mail templates available, the e-mail will be sent in English by default. 
* **Custom e-mail** - Use this field to specify an e-mail address that is different from the address listed in the customer's profile. This field is optional, and by default, all e-mails will be sent to the primary e-mail address of the customer.

> Please note that all e-mails will only be resent to the owner of the reservation. If you would like to resend e-mails to any companions on the booking, you must manually enter their e-mail addresses in the `Custom e-mail` field.
