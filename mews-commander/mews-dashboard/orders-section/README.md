# Orders Section

The Mews Navigator application is a great tool that allows hotels to make guides, messaging, and products easily available. After downloading the application, guests can place orders from the comfort of their rooms using their very own smart devices.

Orders are directly accessible from the dashboard. If there are not any orders to be processed, the donut will not appear. Instead you will see a message saying, "Nothing to be done."

> * Please note that only orders made using the dashboard of the customer profile will appear in the orders donut. All other items will be automatically processed and will not appear on your dashboard. Please check your item settings in the `Options` section if you would like to change this setting.

## New orders

New orders will create a notifications, which are visible from the top bar by the 'Bell' icon, and also from the dashboard under the 'Orders' donut. These new orders will appear in blue on the dashboard donut, which indicates that action is required.

To view all orders, click on 'Orders to Process' or the blue donut itself. This will take you directly to the 'Current orders' page, where you can see a list of 'Orders to process'.

Click on the name of the service to open and view order details.

Orders to process are displayed with the following information:

* **Service** - Item that was ordered; click on service name to view order detail

  * **Cancel** - Click on `x` icon to cancel order; please see below for additional information

## Process

To process the order, click on the `Checkmark` icon. This will automatically post the item on the guest bill and inform the guest that the order has been processed.

You can also comment on the order. Comments will be sent to the guest directly, so if you have any questions, this is the best way to ask the guest.

## Cancel

To cancel the order, click on the `x` icon. This will not send a notification to your guest, so you may want to send a message informing them of the reason for cancellation.

## Order detail

To view the details of any order, click on the `Service` name of any order. A modal window will open with the following order details displayed:

* **Customer** - Name of customer who ordered; click on this name for a direct link to their customer profile `Billing` tab
* **Service** - Item that was ordered
* **Date and time** - Date and time that the order was started
* **State** - Current state of order
* **Total amount** - Total cost of order including all items
* **Notes** - Any additional notes or important information
* **Created \(UTC\)** - Date and time that order was created

* **Items** - This section will include each item in the order
  * **Item** - Name of item
  * **Count** - Count for each item included
  * **Cost** - Cost of the total count for items

## Action log

To view an order's action log, open the order details by clicking on the name of the service. On the right-hand side of the modal window, you can see a list of all changes that have been made in relation to this order.

## Archived orders

Once an order has been processed, it will revert to the "archived orders" overview. Via the time/date filters you can expand or shorten the time period for which you would like to see the orders.

Once processed, and outside of the editable history window, its no longer possible to modify orders in any way except for updating a comment linked to the order. So if you wish to cancel a processed order, this is not possible, and you will have to post a rebate to make this correction.
