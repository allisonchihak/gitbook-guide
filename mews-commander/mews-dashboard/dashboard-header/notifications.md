# Notifications

Notifications are produced automatically by the system and are used to alert users of new bookings, export updates, release notes, failed device commands, and service orders created by customers.

Notifications are always accessible from the header of the Mews dashboard using the `Bell` icon. Below, you will find a detailed description about your notifications in Mews.

## New

Your new and most recent notifications are visible in the `Bell` icon drop-down. Each notification contains the following pieces of information:

* **Sender** - First and last name of sender, displayed with their profile image
* **Type icon** - Different types of notification will be accompanied by their corresponding icon, which is helpful for easy identification
* **Content** - Reason for notification, displayed in bold
* **Sent time** - Date and time that notification was produced

When you receive a new notification, the system will produce a bell sound and you will see a number in orange over the `Bell` icon, which corresponds to the number of new notifications.

Click on the `Bell` icon to open a drop-down, where each new notification is marked with an orange state badge labeled `New`, indicating that action is required. You can click directly on each notification to open the corresponding booking, order, report, or link.

After clicking on a new notification, it will automatically be marked as read. As described below, you can use the ellipses symbol to change the status of a notification later.

In the notifications drop-down menu, you can click the `Mark all as read` button to simultaneously change the status of all notifications to `Read`. Mews would recommend against using this feature, as it is important to read all system notifications.

## Ellipses

Within the new notification drop-down, you will see an `ellipses` icon next to each item. If the notification is new, you will see an option labeled `Mark as seen`. Click on this option to remove the `New` badge and also to remove the corresponding number from the `Bell` icon in your Dashboard header.

If a notification is not new, you will see an option called `Mark as pending` when you click on the `ellipses` icon. This will re-add the `New` badge to that notification and will add a number back to the `Envelope` icon on your Dashboard header.

## Multi-property

If you have access to multiple properties from your profile, notifications from the current property are always displayed when you click on the `Bell` icon. Any notifications from other properties will be visible from the same place, however they will be listed under the name of the property to which they apply.

## Settings

When configuring your stay settings, there are several items that relate directly to notifications.

Navigate to your stay settings using the following path:

* **Main Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Services &gt; Stay**

You will find the following items under the expandable `Options` section:

* **Options** - Under the `Options` section and open the `Options` drop-down
  * **New orders automatically processed** - When this service is ordered, it will automatically be processed. If not selected, an employee must manually accept and process an order. This is primarily important for orders from Mews Navigator, which require an employee to manually process. For example if a guest orders Room Service via Navigator, reception should "accept the order", which informs the guest that the order is being processed.
* **Order generates notification** - When an order is made, the system will generate a notification in Mews to the responsible employee and all members of the responsible department

Additionally, you will find the following items under the expandable `Responsibility` section:

* **Responsible employee** - Select the employee who is responsible for stay services. This person will be informed when new orders are received.
* **Responsible department** - Select the department who is responsible for stay services. Each member of this department will be informed when new orders are received.
* **Notify responsible employee about**
  * **Channel Manager** - Display notifications for all bookings received via Channel Manager
  * **Commander** - Display notifications for all bookings created directly in Commander
  * **Distributor** - Display notifications for all bookings received via Mews Distributor.
