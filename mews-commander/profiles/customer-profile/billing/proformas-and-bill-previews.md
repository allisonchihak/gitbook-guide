# Proformas and Bill Previews

Proforma invoices are used to preview an invoice before the official tax document is issued to a customer. Bill previews are used for the same purpose, however as a preview of an bill before it is balanced and closed.

Proforma invoices and bill previews can be sent to a customer in advance of a stay or used as an estimate of goods and services before payment.

Please note that proforma invoices and bill previews are purely informational, possessing no actual accounting value. Invoices and bills only become valid tax documents after they have been reviewed and issued/closed, at which point a number is assigned and the document can no longer be edited.

## Proforma Invoices

To create a proforma invoice, navigate to the customer profile `Billing` page. Move all items to the `Open bills` section, look for the `Proforma invoice` button and click on it. In the next window, complete the following fields to see the preview:

* **Due date** - Date that payment should be received by
* **Unique identifier** - Any identifying number provided by your accounting software.
* **Currency \(informative\)** - Select the currency that the invoice should be displayed in. If no currency is selected, your default currency will be used.
* **Options** - choose from these additional options
  * **Display customer** - It may not be necessary to include the name of the customer if bill is assigned to a company.
  * **Display taxation** - It may not be necessary to include taxation information for the preview. Please note that final closed bills will always include tax information.
* **Google address search** - These fields will be pre-filled with the most recent and most complete address that is available within the customer's profile; if incorrect, use the Google address search by typing the correct address and then selecting it to automatically populate all address details
* **Notes** - Add any additional notes or information. This field will be editable after the bill is closed.
