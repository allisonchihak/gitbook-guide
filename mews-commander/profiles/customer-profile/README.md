# Customer Profile

The customer profile is the internal Mews profile of each guest that will stay at your property. Connect all reservations, bills, and orders to each person, so that all their information is visible and organized in one place.

* [E-mail](./#e-mail)
* [Tabs](./#tabs)
* [Create](./#create)

## E-mail

The unique identifier of a guest is the e-mail address of that person. If a new profile is created with an e-mail address that is already registered, it will be merged automatically into previously created customer profile.

For this reason, be sure to update customer profiles only with an e-mail address belonging to the guest \(never use the e-mail of a travel agent or secretary\).

Initial login details are sent to customers via their confirmation e-mail. Once they receive this access, they can complete their profile in Mews Navigator.

If a customer needs to reset their password or if they didn't receive their login details, you can visit [http://www.mews.li](http://www.mews.li/) and click on the `Reset password` link. Guests can enter their e-mail address and a password recovery link will be sent.

Furthermore, for the system to work in the most optimal way, e-mail addresses are used to invite customers to check in online. If we do not have the guest's e-mail, we are unfortunately not able to offer them this great service.

## Tabs

The customer profile is split up into the following 5 sub-sections:

* [Dashboard](dashboard.md)
* [Profile](profile.md)
* [Internals](internals.md)
* [Payments](payments/)
* [Billing](billing/)

## Create

Its possible to create new customer profiles from the following locations in the system:

1. New Reservation Screen &gt; type last name into `Customer` field and select `New Customer` 
2. Main Menu &gt; Profiles &gt; `Customer`
3. Reservation module &gt; Groups tab &gt; `Add a new customer`
4. Search bar &gt; type last name into search bar and select `New Customer` 

For the initial creation of the customer profile we ask for the following details:

* **E-mail - **Customer's primary e-mail address. It is very important to include the customer's primary address because they will receive important information via e-mail, such as confirmations and invitations for online check-in.
* **Title** - Please note that this section is the only place where gender is recorded for data purposes
  * **Mr.** - Select for married and unmarried guests that identify as male
  * **Mrs.** - Select this option for married guests that identify as female
  * **Ms.** - Select this option for unmarried guests that identify as female
* **First name** - Customer's given first and middle names
* **Last name** - Customer's last name \(surname\) only
* **Nationality** - Select the country where this customer is from
* **Telephone** - Customer's primary telephone number. Please be sure to include proper country codes for international numbers.
* **Birth date** - Customer's date of birth

Once the profile is created you are redirected to the full profile with a complete set of fields.

> Please note that if your enterprise operates multiple chains, customer profiles will be shared in Mews between all of these properties. Therefore, if a profile already exists, you will be able to find that data in the system for each property.
