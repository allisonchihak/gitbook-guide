## Print & Export

### **Print**

All reports can be printed, by clicking the print button at the top right of the screen. In order to print, you need to have a local printer integrated directly into Mews. How to set up your printers, you can read this in the "Settings" section, under "Connector Integrations"

If you do not have a printer connected, it will simply generate a PDF version of the report, and you can then print it from there.

Please note that if your printer has not received the print command from Mews after one hour, the status of that printing job will automatically turn to 'Canceled'. In case print commands are not being received in real time for any reason, this setting will prevent a build up of printing jobs when the connection is restored.

### **Export to Excel**

All reports can also be exported into a macro-friendly excel file. Simply set the filters on your report, and press "OK" and it will offer you the option to export it to Excel.
