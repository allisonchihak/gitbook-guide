# Snapshot

The SnapShot Marketplace is a fully-integrated ecosystem where all hotel data is centralized, structured, and connected. Snapshot allows properties to view and analyze their data using integrated dashboards and a completely customizable software stack.

## Create

After creating the Snapshot integration in your system, Snapshot will request validation reports, which you can create in Mews and send to complete your setup.

Snapshot uses our `Manager report` to validate data and will get in touch with your property suggesting the date and time the report should be generated in Mews. At the agreed date and time the hotel needs to generate a `Manager report` with the following filters:

* **Mode** - Day
* **Start** - First day of the previous month
* **End** - Last day of the next month
* **Group by** - Accounting category classification
* **Status** - Confirmed
* **Values** - Net

> ### Mews Clues
>
> If the report is exported on 7th March, the `Start` will be 1st February and `End` will be 30th April.

You can export this data directly to Snapshot. Next, they will validate the data to create your dashboards.

If there are any problems with the data, Snapshot will contact your property directly. In this case, please also inform the Mews integrations team at integrations@mewssystems.com
