## Default Counters

For Bill counters its important to always select one of the counter as a "default counter" which is the counter it will preselect upon closing of a bill or invoice by default. Should the user wish to have a bill following a different numbering, upon closing of the bill, they can manually reassign the counter, prior to closing the bill.
