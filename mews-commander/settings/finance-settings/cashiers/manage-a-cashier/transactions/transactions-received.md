### Transactions:

## Transaction Received

This is where employees can post small incoming cash payments for internal use.

To enter a new received amount, click on the 'Transaction received' button from the Cashiers page. You will need to complete the following fields:

* **Currency** - Select the correct currency of the cash you're receiving from the drop-down list of your property's enabled currencies.
* **Value received** - This is the monetary value of the transaction that you are receiving. 
* **Notes** - Enter the reason for the transaction \(i.e. flowers for reception\). You could also add any additional comments or information that you'd like to be associated with this transaction. Please note that this is a required field. 

When all information is entered, click the 'Save' button. Once saved, you will see the new transaction in the current list of transactions for that particular cashier.

### Mews Clues:

In order for a transaction to be linked to revenue reports, it must be posted as a cash payment on the Billing Screen of the guests' profile. This ensures that the system will recognize the payment as revenue.

Revenue is evident in the system when you can see two corresponding bill items. The first is the total value of goods, often itemized, and the second is a negative value representing what was paid. These two can be found alongside one another on an open bill and the balance of both items adds up to a value of $0 when a bill is ready to be closed.

If cash is posted directly to the cashier as a transaction received, revenue is not automatically posted against it, so it is therefore considered a simple cash exchange, which do not impact accounting reports.

* **Example 1: **If an employee is sent to a shop to buy flowers using money directly from the cashier, it can be entered as a transaction paid and the receipt would be included in the shift overview. In this case only an outgoing payment is posted in the cashier, which will not impact accounting reports.
* **Example 2: **If a customer pays for a minibar item in cash, you must to go to their Guest Profile, post the minibar item on an open bill, and then post the cash as a payment, which will appear as a separate transaction on the open bill. In this scenario, both revenue and the payment are posted and will be included in accounting reports.
