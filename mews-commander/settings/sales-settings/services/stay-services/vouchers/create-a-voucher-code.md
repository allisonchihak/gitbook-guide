# Create a Voucher Code

## Create a Voucher Code

Once you have created the Voucher, in order to make it bookable via the Mews Distributor with a promotion code, you will need to create a Voucher Code

Simply click on the + button in the settings, and fill in the value \(the promotion code you wish to use\).

**Valid from/to**: this field is important if you would like the voucher code to be useable only in a specific period. The voucher will not work in any date outside of that period.
