Using HTML to set up the following e-mail types. HTML is used to allow for more specific and tailored formatting options. For more information about placeholders, [`click here`](https://github.com/mews-systems/commander-guide/tree/aba4aad5c9d2bc8ec74b2a6c202f25d981c8b45b/settings/sales-settings/services/stay-settings/mail-templates/placeholders.html).

Please note that each type of mail template can only be created once. Therefore, if each of the six e-mail templates have already been created, you will no longer see the `+` icon available in the `Mail templates` page for adding additional templates. Below, you will find a description of each type of e-mail template available, along with any additional settings that may be applicable to each one.

## After end

After end e-mails are sent to customers at the moment that they have completed checkout. Your property can include any important information, such as survey links, information about future promotions, or a simple 'Thank you' message. This would also be a great place to request your guests to leave a review of your property for sites such as Tripadvisor.

To send after end e-mails automatically, use the following path:

`Main Menu > Settings > Services > Stay > Options tab > Visit options > Enable automatic after end e-mail`

## After start

After start e-mails are sent to customers at the moment that they have completed check-in. This can be used to send a welcome message to customers who have just arrived at your property. You could also include information about any special events that may be happening during their stay, or you could mention any important details that you think they should know.

To send after start e-mails automatically, use the following path:

`Main Menu > Settings > Services > Stay > Options tab > Visit options > Enable automatic after start e-mail`

## Cancellation

Cancellation e-mails are sent to customers any time that their reservations are canceled. This is to be sure that the customer is always informed about the event and so they can maintain records regarding the cancellation. Within the Reservation module `State` tab and under the `Cancellation` section, you can choose whether or not to select `Send e-mail` before canceling.

To enable cancellation e-mails by default, use the following path:

`Main Menu > Settings > Services > Stay > Options tab > Visit options > Send cancellation e-mail by default`

If you do choose to select this option, the `Send e-mail` box will automatically be pre-selected in case of cancellations.

## Confirmation

This e-mail is sent to customers when they have successfully booked a reservation via Mews Distributor. If a booking is created manually in Mews Commander, the creator can choose whether they would like to send a confirmation on the last step under the `Confirmation` field by selecting `Send`, `Do not send`, or `Send to custom e-mail`.

Confirmation e-mail always include a button for online check-in, which you can modify and customize using [`Placeholders`](https://github.com/mews-systems/commander-guide/tree/aba4aad5c9d2bc8ec74b2a6c202f25d981c8b45b/settings/sales-settings/services/stay-settings/mail-templates/placeholders.html). Confirmation e-mails can also be a great place to include items for upselling as well recommendations or any other important information that your guests should know during their stay.

Group confirmation e-mails will include the total number of reservations, total number of guests, and total cost.

> Please note that if you send your confirmation to custom e-mail, the link to check-in online will not allow the possibly different person to get into profile of the reservation owner. The e-mail will contain a link to sign-in screen of navigator. As a solution, please be sure that guests use their primary e-mail address on their customer profile and not sending it to custom e-mail addresses.

To enable confirmation e-mails by default, use the following path:

`Main Menu > Settings > Services > Stay > Options tab > Visit options > Send confirmation e-mail by default`

If you do choose to select this option, the `Send` option in the new reservation screen will automatically be pre-selected in the last step.

## Quotation

When creating Optional reservation you have the possibility of sending a `Quotation` e-mail in place of a confirmation. This e-mail will include all reservation details in addition to the `Release date` of the booking. If created manually in Mews Commander, the creator can choose whether they would like to send a quotation to the customer on the last step under the `Quotation` field by selecting `Send`, `Do not send`, or `Send to custom e-mail`.

## Release reminder

Use this template to create a reminder e-mail that is sent to customers with unconfirmed optional reservations, so that those bookings can either be confirmed or canceled. This can prevent optional bookings from blocking your availability longer than necessary.

To enable confirmation e-mails by default, use the following path:

`Main Menu > Settings > Services > Stay > Options tab > Visit options > Send confirmation e-mail by default`

Navigate to your stay settings and select `Enable automatic release reminder e-mail`, which will send a reminder to the customer 24 hours before the release date. If you have also enabled `Enable automatic option cancellation`, the system will automatically release unconfirmed bookings 24 hours past that chosen release date to free up inventory at your property.

> If you have not completed any of the aforementioned mail templates, the system will still send a default e-mail with the most important information.
>
> When creating a mail template, the system will pre-fill the text field for each one with a English-US translation template for you to better understand the required formatting. This template is what is sent automatically in case customized templates have not yet been created.

> Placeholders can be used to generate text or specific booking information from the system. Placeholders appear as "empty" parts of the text, which, in the e-mail itself is replaced by specific information from the system. It is very important that you do not remove placeholders. Placeholders can automatically add the names of guests or other information about the booking. For additional information, please see our article about [`placeholders`](https://github.com/mews-systems/commander-guide/tree/aba4aad5c9d2bc8ec74b2a6c202f25d981c8b45b/settings/sales-settings/services/stay-settings/mail-templates/placeholders.html).
