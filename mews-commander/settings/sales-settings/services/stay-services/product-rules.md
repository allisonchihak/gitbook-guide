# Product Rules

Product rules allow you to set up different package rules that add or remove products from reservations automatically upon creation.

Navigate to the product rules page, where you will see a list of existing rules. At the top of the page, you will see a drop-down menu:

* **Group by** - this option allows you to sort the product rules in whatever order is most useful. You can select from the following options.
  * [**Business segment**](https://github.com/mews-systems/commander-guide/tree/aba4aad5c9d2bc8ec74b2a6c202f25d981c8b45b/settings/sales-settings/services/stay-settings/business-segments.md)
  * **Product**
  * [**Rate**](rates/)
  * [**Rate group**](rate-groups/)
  * **Space category**
  * **Space type**

Each rule will be displayed with the following information:

* **Conditions** - This will display the selections you've made for your rule
* **Action** - Add or Cancel 
* **Product Rule** - The product that the rule applies to
* **Priority** - Importance of the rule, with the lowest number meaning most important. Please note that only the most important applicable rule is used. 
* **Created** - Date and time that the rule was created
