# Cancellation Policies

## Cancellation Policies

The system calculates which cancellation conditions should be charged to guests based on the time of the cancellation. Let’s say you have a rate with a cancellation policy of 24 hours prior to arrival. The system knows that your check-in time is 15:00, so if you cancel the reservation at 14:59 the day prior, it knows not to charge any fee. If it were one minute later, however, it would correctly post cancellation fees.

* To set a new cancellation condition, select the + button for "New Cancellation Policy" in the "Options" section of rates. You can select for the specific rate type how many days prior the guest is allowed to cancel free of charge. If the guest cannot cancel, then leave this field black.
* Applicability: 
  * Creation: cancellation policy is applied from the moment of creation \(for non refundable rates\)
  * Start: cancellation policy is applied from the start time of the booking
  * Start Date: cancellation policy is applied from the start of the day of arrival \(midnight\)
* Applicability offset: if you would like to set an offset versus the applicability time. For example if you would like the cancellation policy to apply 1 day before the arrival, you would set this field up with "-1 Days".
* Absolute Fee : If you want to charge a fixed cancellation fee, put the amount in this field.
* Currency: in which currency would you wish the absolute fee to be charged?
* Relative fee: If you want to charge a percentage, complete the field here.
* Cancellation Fee Maximum Nights: This is an important field that requires careful attention. If you complete it with the number “1”, it will charge 1 night cancellation fee \(adjusted by the cancellation fee percentage\). If you complete it with “0”, it will not charge any cancellation fee. If you leave the field blank, it will charge the reservation fully, adjusted by the cancellation percentage.
* Fee extent: to which parts of the booking would you like to apply the cancellation fee, to the complete value, or only the nights?

### Examples of Cancellation Policies

--&gt; Fully Flexible / BAR: If you set a rate with a cancellation condition to allow cancellations up to 24 hours prior to arrival \(24 hours prior to the official check-in time set in the system\) and you cancel a booking within the 24 hours, it will automatically post the cancellation charge \(at 0% VAT\) and remove the stay charges.

--&gt; You should only close bills on the day of check-out, because if you close a bill before check-out and try to shorten the reservation or cancel it, the system will attempt to correct the charges on the closed bill \(as they were posted at the wrong VAT level\). This may result in new charges \(cancellation charges\) being posted on the bill.

--&gt; If you try to cancel a bill "Without Fee” but have already closed the bill, then the system will post refunds automatically on the bill.
